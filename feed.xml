But in reality, task killers can reduce your phone's performance and battery life. Here we're explaining the reason.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Basically, the Task Killers kills the particular app that is residing in the memory, thus freeing up your phone's memory. But in fact, Android's own memory management is so powerful that you don't need to use any Task Killer.

Some think it's just a new visual interface slapped on top of Windows 7, and if you think so, I'm afraid you are wrong!&amp;nbsp;Windows 8 has seen a lot of security improvements, including an inbuilt antivirus, an application reputation system, and protection from boot-time rootkits and viruses/malwares.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;There are quite a few low-level security improvements under the hood as well. Microsoft&amp;nbsp;hasn't&amp;nbsp;spelled out all of them, but Windows 8 manages memory in a more secure way and includes features that make it more secure than Windows 7 and security vulnerabilities harder to exploit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;So, here we're discussing the major security improvements that Windows has seen from transition to Windows 8 from Windows 7. There are 6 of them to be precise, so here we go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Windows Defender (An Integrated Antivirus)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Finally, yeah finally, Microsoft has come up with an inbuilt or integrated Antivirus solution that ships with any edition of Windows 8. It's named Windows Defender - but it's just a rename of the popular free antivirus Microsoft Security Essentials. It's the same Microsoft Security Essential that you might be using on your Windows 7 PC (If not upgraded to Windows 8 yet!). Though you can any antivirus that you want on your Windows 8 machine. In such scenario, Windows Defender will disable itself automatically in order to avoid any conflicts with the third party antivirus. Though you need not to do so, as Windows Defender is a very capable product that you won't need any third party antivirus. Moreover, it's deeply integrated into the system that ensures that Windows users will finally have an integrated antivirus protection out-of-the-box.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZG-xWxl6RP4/UJy2qTWTGNI/AAAAAAAABWg/uk-Wlbno_jc/s1600/image34.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;288&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZG-xWxl6RP4/UJy2qTWTGNI/AAAAAAAABWg/uk-Wlbno_jc/s400/image34.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;There is an Anti-Malware Solution As Well&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;In Windows 8, the booting priority of the antivirus is set higher than any other components. Which means that at boot time, first the antivirus will start and will check drivers for any&amp;nbsp;suspicious malwares. This greatly protects the PC from the rootkit attack that starts before antivirus and hide from them.&amp;nbsp;Windows Defender starts earlier in the boot process out-of-the-box, and third-party antivirus vendors can also add the Early-Launch Anti-Malware (ELAM) feature to their products. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Secure Boot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;On new Windows 8 computers that use the UEFI firmware instead of the old-style BIOS, Secure Boot guarantees that only specially signed and approved software can run at boot. On current computers, malware could install a malicious boot loader that loads before the Windows boot loader, starting a boot-level rootkit (or “bootkit”) before Windows even launches. The rootkit could then hide itself from Windows and antivirus software, pulling the strings in the background.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Intel x86 PCs, you’ll be able to add your own security keys to the UEFI firmware, so you could even have your system boot only secure Linux boot loaders that you’ve signed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Improvements in Memory Management&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hXu1m_mNCgI/UJy3KjfE5bI/AAAAAAAABWo/cLhFN3j_G_4/s1600/pile-of-ram.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;184&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hXu1m_mNCgI/UJy3KjfE5bI/AAAAAAAABWo/cLhFN3j_G_4/s400/pile-of-ram.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;In this area, Microsoft has made many under-the-hood improvements compared to Windows 7 in Windows 8.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;When a security hole is found, these improvements can make the security hole harder or even impossible to exploit.

If you downloaded and ran a Windows game, it could install drivers on your system, read files from everywhere on your hard drive, and install malware on your computer. Even if programs&amp;nbsp;run with limited credentials thanks to UAC, they typically install with Administrator privileges and can do anything they want during installation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Windows 8 apps function more like web pages and mobile apps on other popular mobile platforms. When you install an app from the Windows Store, that app has limited access to your system.

Some think it's just a new visual interface slapped on top of Windows 7, and if you think so, I'm afraid you are wrong!&amp;nbsp;Windows 8 has seen a lot of security improvements, including an inbuilt antivirus, an application reputation system, and protection from boot-time rootkits and viruses/malwares.There are quite a few low-level security improvements under the hood as well. Microsoft&amp;nbsp;hasn't&amp;nbsp;spelled out all of them, but Windows 8 manages memory in a more secure way and includes features that make it more secure than Windows 7 and security vulnerabilities harder to exploit.So, here we're discussing the major security improvements that Windows has seen from transition to Windows 8 from Windows 7. There are 6 of them to be precise, so here we go.Windows Defender (An Integrated Antivirus)Finally, yeah finally, Microsoft has come up with an inbuilt or integrated Antivirus solution that ships with any edition of Windows 8. It's named Windows Defender - but it's just a rename of the popular free antivirus Microsoft Security Essentials. It's the same Microsoft Security Essential that you might be using on your Windows 7 PC (If not upgraded to Windows 8 yet!). Though you can any antivirus that you want on your Windows 8 machine. In such scenario, Windows Defender will disable itself automatically in order to avoid any conflicts with the third party antivirus. Though you need not to do so, as Windows Defender is a very capable product that you won't need any third party antivirus. Moreover, it's deeply integrated into the system that ensures that Windows users will finally have an integrated antivirus protection out-of-the-box.There is an Anti-Malware Solution As WellIn Windows 8, the booting priority of the antivirus is set higher than any other components. Which means that at boot time, first the antivirus will start and will check drivers for any&amp;nbsp;suspicious malwares. This greatly protects the PC from the rootkit attack that starts before antivirus and hide from them.&amp;nbsp;Windows Defender starts earlier in the boot process out-of-the-box, and third-party antivirus vendors can also add the Early-Launch Anti-Malware (ELAM) feature to their products. Secure BootOn new Windows 8 computers that use the UEFI firmware instead of the old-style BIOS, Secure Boot guarantees that only specially signed and approved software can run at boot. On current computers, malware could install a malicious boot loader that loads before the Windows boot loader, starting a boot-level rootkit (or “bootkit”) before Windows even launches. The rootkit could then hide itself from Windows and antivirus software, pulling the strings in the background.On Intel x86 PCs, you’ll be able to add your own security keys to the UEFI firmware, so you could even have your system boot only secure Linux boot loaders that you’ve signed.Improvements in Memory ManagementIn this area, Microsoft has made many under-the-hood improvements compared to Windows 7 in Windows 8.&amp;nbsp;When a security hole is found, these improvements can make the security hole harder or even impossible to exploit. Some types of exploits that function on earlier versions of Windows wouldn’t function at all on Windows 8.Microsoft hasn’t spelled out all of these improvements, but they have mentioned a few:Mitigations that were once applied to Windows applications are now also applied to the Windows kernel.ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) has been extended to more parts of Windows, randomly moving data and code around in memory to make it harder to exploit.Internet Explorer 10 includes improvements that make 75% of the security vulnerabilities reported over the last two years more difficult to exploit.The Windows heap, where Windows applications receive their memory from, includes additional checks to defend against exploit techniques.If you're interested in exploring all the improvements, they can be found here.Sandboxing of The New AppsApps for Windows 8’s new Modern interface (formerly known as Metro) are sandboxed and restricted in what they can do on your computer.On the Windows desktop, applications had full access to your system. If you downloaded and ran a Windows game, it could install drivers on your system, read files from everywhere on your hard drive, and install malware on your computer. Even if programs&amp;nbsp;run with limited credentials thanks to UAC, they typically install with Administrator privileges and can do anything they want during installation.Windows 8 apps function more like web pages and mobile apps on other popular mobile platforms. When you install an app from the Windows Store, that app has limited access to your system. It can’t run in the background and monitor all your keystrokes, logging your credit card number and online banking passwords like applications on the traditional Windows desktop can. it doesn’t have access to every file on your system.Apps for Windows 8’s new Modern interface are also only available through the Windows Store, which is more controversial. However, users can’t install malicious Modern apps from outside the store. They’d have to go through the Windows Store, where Microsoft has the ability to pull them if they’re discovered to be malicious.Smartscreen FilterPreviously used only in Internet Explorer, the SmartScreen filter is now implemented at the operating system-level. It will be used to scan EXE files you download from Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and other programs. When you download and double-click an EXE file, Windows will scan the file and send its signature to Microsoft’s servers. If the application is known-good, such as the installer for iTunes, Photoshop, or another popular program, Windows will allow it to run. If it’s known-bad, perhaps if it contains malware, Windows will prevent it from running. If it’s new and Windows doesn’t know what it is, Windows will warn you and allow you to bypass the warning.This feature should help less-experienced users from downloading and running malicious programs from the Internet. Even new pieces of malware will be detected by the SmartScreen filter as an unknown new program that should be approached with caution.So, the conclusion is that Windows 8 is&amp;nbsp;definitely&amp;nbsp;more secure than Windows 7.&amp;nbsp;An integrated antivirus and application reputation system, along with a tamed app ecosystem that replaces the wild-west nature of previous versions of Windows, will probably make the most difference for inexperienced users that may not have ran an antivirus or knew which applications were safe to install on previous versions of Windows. Low-level improvements to the way Windows manages memory will help everyone, even power users like us!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Still No Jelly Bean For Your Android?

If you want to check out all the main improvements in detail check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technotravel.in/2012/06/google-announces-android-41-jelly-bean.html&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. It's been the fastest and the most feature-rich Android OS till date. Though it's great to see these new technology already released, the update schedule to actually implement it on the broader level is rather unacceptable. Though it is now roughly around 3 months from the initial announcement of Jelly Bean at Google I/O, there are hardly any devices other than Nexus devices (Which receive updates directly from Google, of course!), that are running on Jelly Bean 4.1.1. Even there is a large number of Mid-range Android devices that are still waiting to receive Ice-Creme Sandwich 4.0.,&amp;nbsp;and even those who do get the update might not see it until a year after Google released it, if not longer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;So, if you're tired of waiting for the updates, and want to have a feel of Jelly Bean, you certainly can tweak your Gingerbread or ICS running Android's UI to get the visual feel of Jelly Bean. Though, to get the performance boost like Jelly Bean, you will have to wait longer, of course.&amp;nbsp;So instead of waiting for either the update or a new phone, you can take advantage of some of the features it provides right on your current version by way of apps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Locker &amp;amp; Launcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zvUa7wMD_wU/UF6b7rtxj3I/AAAAAAAABTU/xLkumi3L-RY/s1600/locker.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zvUa7wMD_wU/UF6b7rtxj3I/AAAAAAAABTU/xLkumi3L-RY/s1600/locker.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The Launcher is not updated much in Jelly Bean from Ice Creme Sandwich. So, any Ice Creme Sandwich launcher will perfectly serve our purpose. In such case, you can opt for having &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobint.hololauncher&quot;&gt;Holo Launcher&lt;/a&gt; which is same as stock ICS/Jelly Bean Launcher.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MY0rBAcFMXU/UF6cLwCIMsI/AAAAAAAABTk/F_uPhQxgVmU/s1600/JB+live.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MY0rBAcFMXU/UF6cLwCIMsI/AAAAAAAABTk/F_uPhQxgVmU/s1600/JB+live.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Whereas, the same story gets repeated in the locker department as well.

If you don't know whether your device is supported or not, just leave a comment for me, I'll surely help you out.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Early Beta of Firefox OS for Smartphones Running On ZTE Smartphone [Video]</title><link href="/TechnoTravel-in/early-beta-of-firefox-os-for-smartphones-running-on-zte-smartphone-video" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Early Beta of Firefox OS for Smartphones Running On ZTE Smartphone [Video]" /><published>2012-09-23T02:59:00+00:00</published><updated>2012-09-23T02:59:00+00:00</updated><id>/TechnoTravel-in/early-beta-of-firefox-os-for-smartphones-running-on-zte-smartphone-video</id><content type="html" xml:base="/TechnoTravel-in/early-beta-of-firefox-os-for-smartphones-running-on-zte-smartphone-video">&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Well, there has been a while when the Firefox OS came into light on &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1805282&quot;&gt;XDA-Developers forums&lt;/a&gt; of Galaxy Nexus.

In day-to-day basis, we often doesn't take care of it more because it is less prone to errors than the other components of your machine and works almost flawlessly every time. But it is also a mechanical part of your system which might come under the &quot;Error Attack&quot;. So here we're discussing about the hard disk errors and the ways to&amp;nbsp;diagnose and prevent them from&amp;nbsp;occurring as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;How Could You Know That Your Disk Is Suffering From Errors?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;There is a nominal reduce in performance which goes unnoticed many times if your disk is suffering from errors. If the amount of errors is large, the transfer speed of your hard drive reduces eventually as the time goes on. The slump in performance might get unnoticed if the your system is equipped with big memory and mighty processor. Which means that if your system is equipped with robust hardware, even a slight performance dip is worth considering!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The checking disk of errors is very easy and can be performed by a novice user as well. There are actually two methods to do that. One is for regular users which deals with windows' user interface using Windows Explorer and the other one is more robust but a bit harder (Not for geeky personalities though), using Command Line Interface.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;As the mass community is not-so geeky, we'll first discuss about the easier way using Windows Explorer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;First of all open &quot;Computer&quot; in Windows Explorer.

Chkdsk /f will remove ACLs that are no longer used. This is often the cause of the rather worrying message: &quot;Windows found problems with the file system. Run chkdsk with the /F (fix) option to correct these.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is normal for chkdsk /F to remove unused index entries and unused security descriptors every time you run it, these do not indicate a problem with the file system. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Scan only (without /f switch)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;If a file needs to be fixed chkdsk will alert you with a message but will not fix the error(s). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;chkdsk may report lost allocation units on the disk - it will produce this report even if the files are in-use (open). If corruption is found, consider closing all files and repairing the disk with /F.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running chkdsk on a data volume that is in use by another program or process may incorrectly report errors when none are present. To avoid this, close all programs or processes that have open handles to the volume.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yibYpWDXuUs/UDnIR3thgjI/AAAAAAAABSk/4hQL2clJVsk/s1600/26-08-2012+12-20-27+PM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yibYpWDXuUs/UDnIR3thgjI/AAAAAAAABSk/4hQL2clJVsk/s1600/26-08-2012+12-20-27+PM.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On computers running Windows 2003 SP1, chkdsk automatically creates a shadow copy, so you can check volumes that are 'in use' by another program or process. This enables an accurate report against a live file server. On earlier versions of Windows, chkdsk would always lock the volume, making data unavailable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Run at Bootup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Running at bootup is often the easiest way to close all open file handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the GUI, chkntfs or the FSUTIL dirty commands to set or query the volumes 'dirty' bit so that Windows will run chkdsk when the computer is restarted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Event Logs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Chkdsk will log error messages in the Event Viewer - System Log. &lt;br /&gt;Chkdsk /f removes ACLs that are no longer used and reports this in the Event Viewer - Application Log.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Cluster (or block) Size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;CHKDSK produces a report that shows the the block /cluster size&lt;br /&gt;typically: &quot;4096 bytes in each allocation unit.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;When the cluster size is greater than 4 KB on an NTFS volume, none of the NTFS compression functions are available.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Exit codes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;0 No errors were found&lt;br /&gt;1 Errors were found and fixed.&lt;br /&gt;2 Could not check the disk, did not or could not fix errors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Notes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Consider the time required to run Chkdsk to repair any errors that occur. Chkdsk times are determined by the number of files on the volume and by the number of files in the largest folder. Chkdsk performance was improved by 30% under Windows 2003 and around 50% in 2008 R2. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To issue chkdsk on a hard drive you must be a member of the Administrators group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When CHKDSK is set to run at boot-up there is a delay to allow the check to be cancelled - this can be configured in the registry:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager&lt;br /&gt;REG_DWORD:AutoChkTimeOutData&lt;br /&gt;The value is the time in seconds that you want CHKDSK to wait (0 = no delay) default is 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chkdsk is also available from the Recovery Console (with different parameters.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Disk Errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&quot;The file system structure on the disk is corrupt and unusable&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have disk corruption, run the drive manufacturers diagnostics: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www3.toshiba.co.jp/storage/english/support/index.htm&quot;&gt;Toshiba&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hitachigst.com/portal/site/en/support/&quot;&gt;Hitachi&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pc.ibm.com/ww/hdd/hddredirect.html&quot;&gt;ibm&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/support/&quot;&gt;Seagate/Maxtor/Freeagent&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.wdc.com/&quot;&gt;Western digital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;How To Prevent Disk Errors From Occurring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Well, to fully prevent disks from errors is quite hard task, but you always can take some precautionary measures to reduce the frequency of the&amp;nbsp;occurrence of such errors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Don't ever directly cut the power supply from hard disk.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt; When the hard disk is on and under full operation, the sudden power cuts can hurt your hard disk big times!

In day-to-day basis, we often doesn't take care of it more because it is less prone to errors than the other components of your machine and works almost flawlessly every time. But it is also a mechanical part of your system which might come under the &quot;Error Attack&quot;. So here we're discussing about the hard disk errors and the ways to&amp;nbsp;diagnose and prevent them from&amp;nbsp;occurring as well.&amp;nbsp;How Could You Know That Your Disk Is Suffering From Errors?There is a nominal reduce in performance which goes unnoticed many times if your disk is suffering from errors. If the amount of errors is large, the transfer speed of your hard drive reduces eventually as the time goes on. The slump in performance might get unnoticed if the your system is equipped with big memory and mighty processor. Which means that if your system is equipped with robust hardware, even a slight performance dip is worth considering!The checking disk of errors is very easy and can be performed by a novice user as well. There are actually two methods to do that. One is for regular users which deals with windows' user interface using Windows Explorer and the other one is more robust but a bit harder (Not for geeky personalities though), using Command Line Interface.As the mass community is not-so geeky, we'll first discuss about the easier way using Windows Explorer.First of all open &quot;Computer&quot; in Windows Explorer. This will show the drives that are currently connected to your computer.Now Right Click on the drive that you want to check for errors. Click Properties.Navigate to Tools tab where you'll find the option to check disk for errors. Click on Check Now (Administrator privileges&amp;nbsp;are required).The pop-up will come up with two options with the option already checked saying &quot;Automatically fix file system errors&quot; and the other one is &quot;Scan for and attempt recovery of bad errors&quot;.The &quot;Automatically fix file system errors&quot; attempts to solve the detected errors automatically on its own. If this option is left unchecked, the Disk Check utility will only check and display errors, but won't solve it.If both the options are checked, it will thoroughly check the disk for errors and will also attempt to solve any physical errors on your hard drive if there exists any. Due to such functionality, it is&amp;nbsp;get-able&amp;nbsp;that it will obviously take more time than the regular Disk Checking but it is more accurate as well.The time taken by this process depends upon the size of the file it is checking. Means, larger the size of file is, the more time it takes to check.Note If one or more of the files on the hard disk are open, you will receive the following message:Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another process. Would you like to schedule this volume to be checked the next time the system restarts?Click on schedule disk check to schedule it on the next reboot.Using Command Line Interface&amp;nbsp;You can do this above mentioned processes and more with chkdsk.exe utility which runs via command line interface. The command that we'll use is CHKDSK.Syntax CHKDSK [drive:][[path]filename] [/F] [/V] [/R] [/L[:size]] Key [drive:] The drive to check. filename File(s) to check for fragmentation (FAT only). /F Automatically Fix file system errors on the disk. /X Fix file system errors on the disk, (Win2003 and above) dismounts the volume first, closing all open file handles. /R Scan for and attempt Recovery of bad sectors. /V Display the full path and name of every file on the disk. /L:size NTFS only: change the log file size to the specified number of kilobytes. If size is not specified, displays the current log size and the drive type (FAT or NTFS). /C Skip directory corruption checks. /I Skip corruption checks that compare directory entries to the file record segment (FRS) in the volume's master file table (MFT)Example:CHKDSK C: /FFixing Errors /FIf the drive is the boot partition, you will be prompted to run the check during the next bootIf you specify the /f switch, chkdsk will show an error if open files are found on the disk.Chkdsk /f will lock the volume, making data unavailable until chkdsk is finished.If you use chkdsk /f on a disk with a very large number of files (millions), chkdsk may take a long time to complete.When you delete a file or folder that has 'custom' permissions, the ACL is not deleted, it is cached. Chkdsk /f will remove ACLs that are no longer used. This is often the cause of the rather worrying message: &quot;Windows found problems with the file system. Run chkdsk with the /F (fix) option to correct these.&quot;It is normal for chkdsk /F to remove unused index entries and unused security descriptors every time you run it, these do not indicate a problem with the file system. Scan only (without /f switch)If a file needs to be fixed chkdsk will alert you with a message but will not fix the error(s). chkdsk may report lost allocation units on the disk - it will produce this report even if the files are in-use (open). If corruption is found, consider closing all files and repairing the disk with /F.Running chkdsk on a data volume that is in use by another program or process may incorrectly report errors when none are present. To avoid this, close all programs or processes that have open handles to the volume.&amp;nbsp;On computers running Windows 2003 SP1, chkdsk automatically creates a shadow copy, so you can check volumes that are 'in use' by another program or process. This enables an accurate report against a live file server. On earlier versions of Windows, chkdsk would always lock the volume, making data unavailable.Run at BootupRunning at bootup is often the easiest way to close all open file handles.Use the GUI, chkntfs or the FSUTIL dirty commands to set or query the volumes 'dirty' bit so that Windows will run chkdsk when the computer is restarted.Event LogsChkdsk will log error messages in the Event Viewer - System Log. Chkdsk /f removes ACLs that are no longer used and reports this in the Event Viewer - Application Log.Cluster (or block) SizeCHKDSK produces a report that shows the the block /cluster sizetypically: &quot;4096 bytes in each allocation unit.&quot; When the cluster size is greater than 4 KB on an NTFS volume, none of the NTFS compression functions are available.Exit codes0 No errors were found1 Errors were found and fixed.2 Could not check the disk, did not or could not fix errors.Notes:Consider the time required to run Chkdsk to repair any errors that occur. Chkdsk times are determined by the number of files on the volume and by the number of files in the largest folder. Chkdsk performance was improved by 30% under Windows 2003 and around 50% in 2008 R2. To issue chkdsk on a hard drive you must be a member of the Administrators group.When CHKDSK is set to run at boot-up there is a delay to allow the check to be cancelled - this can be configured in the registry:HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session ManagerREG_DWORD:AutoChkTimeOutDataThe value is the time in seconds that you want CHKDSK to wait (0 = no delay) default is 10 seconds.Chkdsk is also available from the Recovery Console (with different parameters.)Disk Errors&quot;The file system structure on the disk is corrupt and unusable&quot;If you have disk corruption, run the drive manufacturers diagnostics: Toshiba | Hitachi | ibm | Seagate/Maxtor/Freeagent | Western digitalHow To Prevent Disk Errors From OccurringWell, to fully prevent disks from errors is quite hard task, but you always can take some precautionary measures to reduce the frequency of the&amp;nbsp;occurrence of such errors.Don't ever directly cut the power supply from hard disk. When the hard disk is on and under full operation, the sudden power cuts can hurt your hard disk big times! So prevent your PC from sudden power cuts, which is the only thing that is in our hands to reduce the frequency of error occurrence.Frequently check and fix disk for errors.

Though you can always backup your important data on your external physical hard drive,&amp;nbsp;but free online backup services provide useful redundancy that could save your data big time!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;If you are a regular TechnoTravel.in reader, you may get this now that we're fan of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technotravel.in/2012/08/pros-and-cons-of-cloud-basedonline-antivirus.html&quot;&gt;cloud computing&lt;/a&gt; and we will be writing numerous articles in coming future to let the world understand it's pros and cons. So, as a part of that effort, here we're mentioning out some useful and FREE websites, 15 to be precise, that offer free cloud storage space to let you backup, share or synchronize your data. Each of these services offers a free plan, most also having options for paid subscriptions that offer more storage space, and possibly additional features. Most of these services offer useful backup features such as automatic backups, scheduling, versioning, and restore features. Some services offer other useful features, such as the ability to access your backed up files anywhere using a browser or mobile apps and the ability to stream your media files to your mobile device.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Microsoft SkyDrive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/skydrive/home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Microsoft SkyDrive&lt;/a&gt; offers 7GB of free data for the new subscribers. It used to offer 25GB in its initial stages, but now it's reduced down to 7GB. Though 7GB is also a good cloud storage space. The old subscribers, like me, are allowed to keep their 25GBs for free.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Store your files on SkyDrive and you can access them from your Android phone, iPhone, iPad, Windows phone in addition to your PC or Mac.&amp;nbsp;Use SkyDrive to share large files and photos with your friends and family. They only need a web browser to access the files and photos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Though there are some drawbacks of SkyDrive that are worth mentioning here. Firstly, it&amp;nbsp;doesn't&amp;nbsp;offer any considerable security to the files you upload, so if you are about to upload your sensitive data on SkyDrive, stop here. The other drawback is that it offers only one folder named SkyDrive, thus if you have data sorted out in many folders, you might find it difficult to upload it on SkyDrive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;With 7 GB of free storage, SkyDrive is a good place to store your photos and other non-sensitive documents. Use other free backup services for your sensitive and private files. We mention which ones provide encryption for files uploaded to and retrieved from their service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9Eick34xGX4/UDHSVClEmVI/AAAAAAAABPU/Pr2qfk2ov9s/s1600/20-08-2012+10-05-48+AM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9Eick34xGX4/UDHSVClEmVI/AAAAAAAABPU/Pr2qfk2ov9s/s1600/20-08-2012+10-05-48+AM.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.box.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Box&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a good backup solution for the small but important files, as it offers 5GB of storage space with the file size limit of 100MB.&amp;nbsp;The free account also allows you to create file sharing links and provides secure transfer and storage of your data.

It allows you to&amp;nbsp;backup your data to your friends, families, and colleague’s computers for free. All backed up files are encrypted locally before they are sent to your buddies’ machines and only you have the encryption keys. So, your buddies can’t read your files.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;You don’t have to worry about your backups staying on your buddies’ computers. You can setup BuddyBackup to backup multiple copies of your files, so you’re sure you have backups. Two copies of your data are spread among your buddies by default. BuddyBackup also regularly checks that your buddies still have your backups. If there is a problem on a buddy’s computer, BuddyBackup automatically backs up your files to a different buddy instead. So, if one of your buddies uninstalls BuddyBackup or their computer fails, your data is still safe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #333333; font-family: Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;You can also backup your data offline to your own external hard drives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your computer crashes and you have to restore your data to a new computer, you can easily do so by running BuddyBackup on your new computer. You can also recover your files from a friend’s computer, if you haven’t replaced your computer yet, using the Guest Mode. In Guest Mode, you can’t add to backups; you can only restore files from existing backups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EJGH6RQiPcM/UDHTf24_H6I/AAAAAAAABP8/_XQN8FSazLY/s1600/20-08-2012+11-11-28+AM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EJGH6RQiPcM/UDHTf24_H6I/AAAAAAAABP8/_XQN8FSazLY/s1600/20-08-2012+11-11-28+AM.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;DropBox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/pricing&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; offers 2 GB of storage for free, and the ability to sync files and folders between your Windows, Mac, or Linux computer and the cloud.

Backups can occur daily or weekly at a specific time of day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you need to restore your data, you can choose to do so using the software client, on the web, or by ordering a DVD to restore. If you’re using Windows, you can also restore your data using the right-click context menu or through the Mozy Virtual Drive. You can restore file versions up to 30 days into the past.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rwA86PAdYmY/UDHT_OQKyMI/AAAAAAAABQU/Yi9i8FTs1j8/s1600/20-08-2012+11-16-36+AM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rwA86PAdYmY/UDHT_OQKyMI/AAAAAAAABQU/Yi9i8FTs1j8/s1600/20-08-2012+11-16-36+AM.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;MiMedia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mimedia.com/&quot;&gt;MiMedia&lt;/a&gt; offers 7 GB of storage space for free, and features such as secure, automatic online backup and cloud sync.

You can use SugarSync not only as an online backup service, but also as a way to sync your files, such as music and photos, among your computers and other devices, such as your Android device, iPhone, iPad, BlackBerry, and Kindle Fire. SugarSync can be handy if you need to transfer files between a PC and a Mac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like Mozy, you can backup your data from any folders on your hard drive. You can also select folders to share with your friends and family. You can edit files on your computer while it’s offline, and the changed files are quietly synced with SugarSync the next time your computer is online without interfering with your productivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SugarSync keeps the previous five versions of all your files so you can reference or restore them in the future. Only the most recent version of each file counts against your storage limit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just want to backup a set of files without automatically syncing them or updating them, you can use SugarSync’s Web Archive feature. Everything stored in the Web Archive is accessible from the web and your mobile devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SugarSync offers mobile apps for devices such as Android, iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, BlackBerry, and Windows Mobile. You can access files backed up to your SugarSync account from any of your other computers, share photos, upload files and photos of any size from your mobile device to your computer (even if it’s turned off), and even edit documents, depending upon the capabilities of your device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Data uploaded to and retrieved from SugarSync’s servers are sent over the Internet using TLS (SSL 3.3) encryption. Every piece of information moved between your computers, mobile devices, and SugarSync’s servers is verified as a secure communication, whether you are backing up files to their servers or restoring files from them. You can also protect folders you share with other people, such as clients or coworkers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SugarSync offers some handy features for transferring music and photos between your mobile devices and your computers. You can also stream music to your mobile device. For Android devices and iPhones, you can sync your music to your phone so you can listen to it offline. Share a large video file by sending a link to the file rather than sending an email with a large attachment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DKUPEZuvOu4/UDHUit9xr7I/AAAAAAAABQs/B6M5dmFB0ek/s1600/20-08-2012+11-20-46+AM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DKUPEZuvOu4/UDHUit9xr7I/AAAAAAAABQs/B6M5dmFB0ek/s1600/20-08-2012+11-20-46+AM.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;ElephantDrive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://home.elephantdrive.com/plans-and-pricing/free-plans/&quot;&gt;ElephantDrive’s Lite Edition&lt;/a&gt; plan offers 2 GB of free online backup space and has all the features of ElephantDrive’s premium plans, including automatic online storage and backup, military-grade encryption, and support for up to three computers or devices.

You can backup using your own computers and external hard drives for onsite backups, as well as backup your data to computers belonging to your friends and family for offsite backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CrashPlan’s backup software runs on PCs, Macs, Linux, and Solaris and backs up data from any combination of these operating systems and from attached hard drives, as well. Backups happen automatically so you don’t have to remember to backup your data or get annoyed from popup dialogs reminding you to perform a backup. You can schedule your backups if you want to control when they are performed. If a backup is interrupted, it is resumed the next time the computers become available again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you backup data to multiple destinations, your data is sent to one destination one at a time. To make sure you have a full backup as soon as possible, the order of your backups is based on which destination will complete first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the free version of CrashPlan, your files are secured before they are transferred to CrashPlan’s servers using enterprise-grade, 128-bit encryption. Paid plans provide 448-bit encryption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no limitations on the size of files you can backup.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m8Op9OAwbC4/UDHU9LdRdZI/AAAAAAAABQ8/t1vwlLVwGXg/s1600/20-08-2012+11-25-23+AM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m8Op9OAwbC4/UDHU9LdRdZI/AAAAAAAABQ8/t1vwlLVwGXg/s1600/20-08-2012+11-25-23+AM.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Ubuntu One&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://one.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu One&lt;/a&gt; allows you to sync up to 5 GB of files to the cloud for free and access it anywhere.

Though you can always backup your important data on your external physical hard drive,&amp;nbsp;but free online backup services provide useful redundancy that could save your data big time!If you are a regular TechnoTravel.in reader, you may get this now that we're fan of cloud computing and we will be writing numerous articles in coming future to let the world understand it's pros and cons. So, as a part of that effort, here we're mentioning out some useful and FREE websites, 15 to be precise, that offer free cloud storage space to let you backup, share or synchronize your data. Each of these services offers a free plan, most also having options for paid subscriptions that offer more storage space, and possibly additional features. Most of these services offer useful backup features such as automatic backups, scheduling, versioning, and restore features. Some services offer other useful features, such as the ability to access your backed up files anywhere using a browser or mobile apps and the ability to stream your media files to your mobile device.Microsoft SkyDriveMicrosoft SkyDrive offers 7GB of free data for the new subscribers. It used to offer 25GB in its initial stages, but now it's reduced down to 7GB. Though 7GB is also a good cloud storage space. The old subscribers, like me, are allowed to keep their 25GBs for free.Store your files on SkyDrive and you can access them from your Android phone, iPhone, iPad, Windows phone in addition to your PC or Mac.&amp;nbsp;Use SkyDrive to share large files and photos with your friends and family. They only need a web browser to access the files and photos.Though there are some drawbacks of SkyDrive that are worth mentioning here. Firstly, it&amp;nbsp;doesn't&amp;nbsp;offer any considerable security to the files you upload, so if you are about to upload your sensitive data on SkyDrive, stop here. The other drawback is that it offers only one folder named SkyDrive, thus if you have data sorted out in many folders, you might find it difficult to upload it on SkyDrive.With 7 GB of free storage, SkyDrive is a good place to store your photos and other non-sensitive documents. Use other free backup services for your sensitive and private files. We mention which ones provide encryption for files uploaded to and retrieved from their service.BoxBox&amp;nbsp;is a good backup solution for the small but important files, as it offers 5GB of storage space with the file size limit of 100MB.&amp;nbsp;The free account also allows you to create file sharing links and provides secure transfer and storage of your data.

It allows you to&amp;nbsp;backup your data to your friends, families, and colleague’s computers for free. All backed up files are encrypted locally before they are sent to your buddies’ machines and only you have the encryption keys. So, your buddies can’t read your files.You don’t have to worry about your backups staying on your buddies’ computers. You can setup BuddyBackup to backup multiple copies of your files, so you’re sure you have backups. Two copies of your data are spread among your buddies by default.

Though you'll need to shell out $4 to get the full&amp;nbsp;featured app, but it's worth buying. So, just test the free version and if it satisfies you, then you can opt for buying it to help the developer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1Ku1H88ryHU/UCpGWFetzwI/AAAAAAAABOg/O8EfCrQd4j4/s1600/FBC+app.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1Ku1H88ryHU/UCpGWFetzwI/AAAAAAAABOg/O8EfCrQd4j4/s200/FBC+app.jpg&quot; width=&quot;119&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The working of the Fast Burst Camera app is pretty simple.

Thus the maximum number of pics you can take are unlimited&amp;nbsp;theoretically but practically it depends on how much memory your Android allots to the app. Though there is no limit on the number of pics to be captured at once, obviously high number of pics will require more memory and will acquire more time to get saved in your gallery, which can be quite cumbersome at times!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The app also provides some settings to get configured by the user like choosing the resolution of the photos and control over memory allocation to this app. Though one thing should be noticed here is, higher the resolution of photos, more time it takes to get saved in your SD card.

DNS is the abbreviated form of the term &quot;Domain Name Server&quot; (You can actually replace Server with Service or System as well!).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The primary job of the DNS server is providing the ip address of the different websites to your computer. Which means, when you type www.google.com or www.yahoo.com in your browser address bar, your computer actually queries the DNS server which it is configured to use. In response to that query DNS server returns the ip address of that queried website, in this case say www.google.com. Thus DNS server will return the ip address of www.google.com's server. With the help of this ip address, your computer can finally reach to Google.com. Thus there is an important role of DNS server to let you access the internet from your PC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;No matter what operating system you use, say &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technotravel.in/search/label/windows&quot;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technotravel.in/search/label/Linux&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technotravel.in/search/label/iOS&quot;&gt;Mac&lt;/a&gt;, your computer have to have DNS server configured to be able to access the Internet. Now, by default, your ISP (Internet Service Provider) has their own DNS server in most cases. Thus up till now, if you haven't changed your DNS server ever, then you surely are running your ISP's DNS server.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, your DNS server can be the weakest link in the entire Internet Workflow. In a easy language, no matter how speedy or robust your internet link is, if the DNS server of your ISP is faulty or say tad slow, it can ruin your browsing experience. If the DNS server of your ISP is slow, it takes more time to reply to the query sent by your computer, resulting in the slowness of the rendering of the webpage. And in India, ISPs seems not to be too concerned about having a robust DNS server. Which means, even if your ISP provides you the speed of 2Mbps, it can feel like 1Mbps if your DNS server is running slow!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;To solve this problem,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;We can always opt for any other DNS server which is faster and equipped with more robust features than your ISP's DNS server. There are plenty of fast DNS servers to choose from to use for your computer, but we like OpenDNS the most.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opendns.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OpenDNS&lt;/a&gt; is a dedicated DNS servers. Which directly means that the developer staff at OpenDNS is only focused on making their DNS server faster and more reliable, nothing else. OpenDNS dramatically speeds up your internet connection and also enhances your overall internet experience as you'll get this after reading the full post.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;How To Get Started?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;There is no need of any software or registration to avail yourself the benefits of OpenDNS. All you need to do is to change your computer's DNS servers with the following ip addresses:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;208.67.222.222&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;208.67.220.220&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Don't know how to change your computer's DNS server? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technotravel.in/2011/08/how-to-change-dns-servers-for-fast.html&quot; target=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is the guide that might help you! &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technotravel.in/2011/08/how-to-change-dns-servers-for-fast.html&quot; target=&quot;&quot;&gt;How To Change DNS Server in Windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The whole process takes a few seconds but with this single step alone, you just made your computer safer and increased the overall browsing speed. Here's why: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Unlike the DNS servers of your less reliable ISP, OpenDNS servers store the IP addresses of millions of websites in their cache so it would take less time to resolve your requests. So if you have asked for an IP address of a website that has been previously requested by another OpenDNS user, you will get the reply instantly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oaBfZRblaSg/UCnxP8vAgUI/AAAAAAAABNw/6HbthGSKPuQ/s1600/opendns.gif&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oaBfZRblaSg/UCnxP8vAgUI/AAAAAAAABNw/6HbthGSKPuQ/s1600/opendns.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Another huge advantage of OpenDNS is that it prevents phishing sites that has ability to steal your important passwords from loading in your computer. Thus OpenDNS does the job which your normal antivirus can't do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The another very good&amp;nbsp;feature&amp;nbsp;is Parental Control.

DNS is the abbreviated form of the term &quot;Domain Name Server&quot; (You can actually replace Server with Service or System as well!).The primary job of the DNS server is providing the ip address of the different websites to your computer. Which means, when you type www.google.com or www.yahoo.com in your browser address bar, your computer actually queries the DNS server which it is configured to use. In response to that query DNS server returns the ip address of that queried website, in this case say www.google.com. Thus DNS server will return the ip address of www.google.com's server. With the help of this ip address, your computer can finally reach to Google.com. Thus there is an important role of DNS server to let you access the internet from your PC.No matter what operating system you use, say Windows, Linux or Mac, your computer have to have DNS server configured to be able to access the Internet. Now, by default, your ISP (Internet Service Provider) has their own DNS server in most cases. Thus up till now, if you haven't changed your DNS server ever, then you surely are running your ISP's DNS server.Unfortunately, your DNS server can be the weakest link in the entire Internet Workflow. In a easy language, no matter how speedy or robust your internet link is, if the DNS server of your ISP is faulty or say tad slow, it can ruin your browsing experience. If the DNS server of your ISP is slow, it takes more time to reply to the query sent by your computer, resulting in the slowness of the rendering of the webpage. And in India, ISPs seems not to be too concerned about having a robust DNS server. Which means, even if your ISP provides you the speed of 2Mbps, it can feel like 1Mbps if your DNS server is running slow!To solve this problem,We can always opt for any other DNS server which is faster and equipped with more robust features than your ISP's DNS server. There are plenty of fast DNS servers to choose from to use for your computer, but we like OpenDNS the most.OpenDNS is a dedicated DNS servers.
