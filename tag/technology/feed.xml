	     <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0ha89vgz4KA/UKsnZpeSuWI/AAAAAAAABZs/z9lMYLnSuXs/s1600/20-11-2012+11-45-37+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0ha89vgz4KA/UKsnZpeSuWI/AAAAAAAABZs/z9lMYLnSuXs/s1600/20-11-2012+11-45-37+AM.png" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Well, there is a rather unknown or "only known to the geeks" shortcut of holding shift key while right clicking on any folder shows up the option "Open Command Prompt Here.."..but I bet 90% of us didn't knew that before they read it here. Now, as we geeks are considered to be laziest person on earth (In terms of physical work, of course!), we're going to prove that right here right now.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Now coming back to the topic, here we've tweaked the registry entries for our goods to remove that "holding shift" barrier to show up "Open Command Prompt Here.." option in the folder right click menu. After editing the registry as mentioned in this post, there is no need to press shift key to have this option. It'll be enabled by default. :cool:</span><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Manual Method</span></h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The first method must be the manual method. Because if I provide one-click solution here, we geeks are too lazy to read the whole article, I guess. So, first we'll see how it's done manually and then an automatic gift will be presented!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">First go to start menu and type regedit.</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-L0fotn7avgw/UKsnlIz4fYI/AAAAAAAABZ0/aLxvIZlS5cg/s1600/20-11-2012+11-49-22+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-L0fotn7avgw/UKsnlIz4fYI/AAAAAAAABZ0/aLxvIZlS5cg/s1600/20-11-2012+11-49-22+AM.png" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Click on regedit.exe which will open Registry Editor.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Now navigate to the following folder :&nbsp;</span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Drive\shell\cmd</b></span>&nbsp;</blockquote><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hf0o9MRuDvc/UKsnxjCyIhI/AAAAAAAABZ8/MvPzZ3wPS9A/s1600/20-11-2012+11-54-55+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hf0o9MRuDvc/UKsnxjCyIhI/AAAAAAAABZ8/MvPzZ3wPS9A/s1600/20-11-2012+11-54-55+AM.png" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div>Rename the “Extended” key on the right to something else, like “Extended-Orig”. (Note that you could simply delete the value, but renaming it ensures that you can quickly rename it back to reverse the change)<br /><br />To add the item to the folder context menu, browse down to the following key:</span><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shell\cmd</b></span></blockquote><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"> And rename the same “Extended” key here. The changes should be immediate.</span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--5VgFofikpI/UKsoJ8Ac-RI/AAAAAAAABaE/ET4dfAO15bg/s1600/20-11-2012+11-55-31+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--5VgFofikpI/UKsoJ8Ac-RI/AAAAAAAABaE/ET4dfAO15bg/s1600/20-11-2012+11-55-31+AM.png" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Download This Registry Tweak</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">If you are not good at these sought of geeky stuff, just download the following file.

	     <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cdkpuL-Vjlo/UJ0y65yLHII/AAAAAAAABX4/9StKfDXJySk/s1600/Screenshot_2012-11-09-22-01-08.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cdkpuL-Vjlo/UJ0y65yLHII/AAAAAAAABX4/9StKfDXJySk/s320/Screenshot_2012-11-09-22-01-08.png" width="180" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Most of Android fans generally use Task Manager to kill the Apps that are consuming RAM which results in the slow performance and poor battery life.&nbsp;By closing apps running in the background,&nbsp;you'll&nbsp;get improved performance and battery life – that’s the idea, anyway. But in reality, task killers can reduce your phone's performance and battery life. Here we're explaining the reason.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Basically, the Task Killers kills the particular app that is residing in the memory, thus freeing up your phone's memory. But in fact, Android's own memory management is so powerful that you don't need to use any Task Killer. In fact, doing so disturbs the automatic process which is rather bad thing.</span><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></h3><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></h3><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Process Management In Android Is Different From Windows</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Most of Android users are very much familiar and used to Windows.&nbsp;On Windows, many programs running at one time – whether they’re windows on your desktop or applications in your system tray – can decrease your computer’s performance. Closing applications when&nbsp;you're&nbsp;not using them can help speed up your Windows computer.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uKq_rLL9O9o/UJ0zWYgvnKI/AAAAAAAABYA/WZKGiKbkVxw/s1600/Screenshot_2012-11-09-22-04-33.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uKq_rLL9O9o/UJ0zWYgvnKI/AAAAAAAABYA/WZKGiKbkVxw/s640/Screenshot_2012-11-09-22-04-33.png" width="640" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">However, Android is&nbsp;altogether&nbsp;a different scenario than Windows. In Windows, there is an obvious way to "close" an application, whereas, this is not the case with Android. You won't find any convincing way to actually "close" an app in Android. Some user might see this as a problem. But in fact, it's in design and not a problem by any means.&nbsp;When you leave an Android app, going back to your home screen or switching to another app, the app stays “running” in the background. In most cases, the app will be paused in the background, taking up no CPU or network resources. Some apps will continue using CPU and network resources in the background, of course – for example, music players, file-downloading programs, or apps that sync in the background.<br /><br />When you go back to an app you were recently using, Android “unpauses” that app and you resume where you left off. This is fast because the app is still stored in your RAM and ready to be used again.</span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Task Killers Are Bad</span></h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YpqN2yeXblE/UJ00AGAB3lI/AAAAAAAABYI/InVyW6Gd0Tc/s1600/Screenshot_2012-11-09-22-01-52.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YpqN2yeXblE/UJ00AGAB3lI/AAAAAAAABYI/InVyW6Gd0Tc/s400/Screenshot_2012-11-09-22-01-52.png" width="225" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Most task killers notice that Android uses a lot of memory - in fact, Android stores running or recently used apps into memory which fills up the RAM. But this, by no means, a bad practice. Apps that are stored in the RAM can be quickly switched back to when needed rather than retrieving it from the storage, which is a very slow process compared to&nbsp;retrieval time from RAM.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">And moreover, the freed up RAM is of no use and it doesn't saves the battery either. We all live in a myth that more free the RAM is, the less power it consumes. But this doesn't holds the truth. The totally full RAM consumes the same amount of power the half-full RAM consumes. So killing tasks or apps will save the battery power holds no truth. And in case of the RAM is full and more memory is needed to run the app than available, Android is smart enough to kill the app automatically which is not used for a while and free up the RAM for the new app. No task killers are&nbsp;required&nbsp;for this purpose.</span></div><div><br /></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Task killers think they know better than Android. They run in the background, automatically quitting apps and removing them from Android’s memory. They may also allow you to force-quit apps on your own, but you&nbsp;shouldn't&nbsp;have to do this.<br /><br />Task killers&nbsp;aren't&nbsp;just useless – they can reduce performance as well. If a task killer removes an app from your RAM and you open that app again, the app will be slower to load as Android is forced to load it from your device’s storage. This will also use more battery power than if you just left the app in your RAM in the first place. Some apps will automatically restart after the task killer quits them, using more CPU and battery resources. Thus reducing the battery life.</span><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Though Task Killers Can Help Sometime</span></h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7DAGQ716Srk/UJ00WUzw7MI/AAAAAAAABYQ/jzEhsAuUsaM/s1600/Screenshot_2012-11-09-22-02-27.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7DAGQ716Srk/UJ00WUzw7MI/AAAAAAAABYQ/jzEhsAuUsaM/s640/Screenshot_2012-11-09-22-02-27.png" width="360" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">At this point of time while you are reading this article, some users won't agree with the fact that are presented to them before. Because they might have noticed a performance boost and increased battery life after using Task Killer.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">This might hold truth by the way! But only in case you have a badly compiled app installed on your phone.&nbsp;If you have a bad app that’s using CPU and other resources in the background, a task killer that closes the misbehaving app can improve your battery life and make your phone faster.</span></div><div><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">However, using a task killer to deal with a misbehaving app is like using a shotgun to kill a fly – you may fix your problem, but&nbsp;you're&nbsp;inflicting a lot of other damage in the process.<br /><br />Instead of using a task killer in this situation, you should identify the bad app and uninstall it, replacing it with an app that works properly. To pin down the app that’s misbehaving, you can try the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zomut.watchdoglite">Watchdog Task Manager</a> app – it will show you which apps are actually using CPU in the background, not which apps are harmlessly being stored in memory.</span><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Conclusion</span></h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Task killers can also cause other problems by killing applications that you want running in the background — for example, if you use an alarm clock app, you may find that your task killer forced the alarm clock app to quit, preventing the alarm from going off.<br /><br />CyanogenMod, the popular community-developed Android Custom ROM,&nbsp;won't&nbsp;even accept bug reports from users using task killers, saying that they cause more problems than they solve.<br /><br />In summary, you&nbsp;shouldn't&nbsp;use a task killer – if you have a misbehaving app wasting resources in the background, you should identify it and uninstall it. But&nbsp;don't&nbsp;just remove apps from your phone or tablet’s RAM – that&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;help speed anything up.</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div></div>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Official release of Windows 8 is a talk of the town right now. Some think it's just a new visual interface slapped on top of Windows 7, and if you think so, I'm afraid you are wrong!&nbsp;Windows 8 has seen a lot of security improvements, including an inbuilt antivirus, an application reputation system, and protection from boot-time rootkits and viruses/malwares.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">There are quite a few low-level security improvements under the hood as well. Microsoft&nbsp;hasn't&nbsp;spelled out all of them, but Windows 8 manages memory in a more secure way and includes features that make it more secure than Windows 7 and security vulnerabilities harder to exploit.</span><br /><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">So, here we're discussing the major security improvements that Windows has seen from transition to Windows 8 from Windows 7. There are 6 of them to be precise, so here we go.</span></div><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Windows Defender (An Integrated Antivirus)</span></h3><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Finally, yeah finally, Microsoft has come up with an inbuilt or integrated Antivirus solution that ships with any edition of Windows 8. It's named Windows Defender - but it's just a rename of the popular free antivirus Microsoft Security Essentials. It's the same Microsoft Security Essential that you might be using on your Windows 7 PC (If not upgraded to Windows 8 yet!). Though you can any antivirus that you want on your Windows 8 machine. In such scenario, Windows Defender will disable itself automatically in order to avoid any conflicts with the third party antivirus. Though you need not to do so, as Windows Defender is a very capable product that you won't need any third party antivirus. Moreover, it's deeply integrated into the system that ensures that Windows users will finally have an integrated antivirus protection out-of-the-box.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZG-xWxl6RP4/UJy2qTWTGNI/AAAAAAAABWg/uk-Wlbno_jc/s1600/image34.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="288" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZG-xWxl6RP4/UJy2qTWTGNI/AAAAAAAABWg/uk-Wlbno_jc/s400/image34.png" width="400" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">There is an Anti-Malware Solution As Well</span></h3><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">In Windows 8, the booting priority of the antivirus is set higher than any other components. Which means that at boot time, first the antivirus will start and will check drivers for any&nbsp;suspicious malwares. This greatly protects the PC from the rootkit attack that starts before antivirus and hide from them.&nbsp;Windows Defender starts earlier in the boot process out-of-the-box, and third-party antivirus vendors can also add the Early-Launch Anti-Malware (ELAM) feature to their products. </span></div><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Secure Boot</span></h3><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">On new Windows 8 computers that use the UEFI firmware instead of the old-style BIOS, Secure Boot guarantees that only specially signed and approved software can run at boot. On current computers, malware could install a malicious boot loader that loads before the Windows boot loader, starting a boot-level rootkit (or “bootkit”) before Windows even launches. The rootkit could then hide itself from Windows and antivirus software, pulling the strings in the background.<br /><br />On Intel x86 PCs, you’ll be able to add your own security keys to the UEFI firmware, so you could even have your system boot only secure Linux boot loaders that you’ve signed.</span><br /><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Improvements in Memory Management</span></h3><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hXu1m_mNCgI/UJy3KjfE5bI/AAAAAAAABWo/cLhFN3j_G_4/s1600/pile-of-ram.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="184" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hXu1m_mNCgI/UJy3KjfE5bI/AAAAAAAABWo/cLhFN3j_G_4/s400/pile-of-ram.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">In this area, Microsoft has made many under-the-hood improvements compared to Windows 7 in Windows 8.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">When a security hole is found, these improvements can make the security hole harder or even impossible to exploit. Some types of exploits that function on earlier versions of Windows wouldn’t function at all on Windows 8.</span></div><div><br /></div><span style="color: #444444;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Microsoft hasn’t spelled out all of these improvements, but they have mentioned a few:</span></span><br /><ul><li><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Mitigations that were once applied to Windows applications are now also applied to the Windows kernel.</span></li><li><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) has been extended to more parts of Windows, randomly moving data and code around in memory to make it harder to exploit.</span></li><li><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Internet Explorer 10 includes improvements that make 75% of the security vulnerabilities reported over the last two years more difficult to exploit.</span></li><li><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The Windows heap, where Windows applications receive their memory from, includes additional checks to defend against exploit techniques.</span></li></ul><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">If you're interested in exploring all the improvements, they <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/15/protecting-you-from-malware.aspx">can be found here</a>.</span></div><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Sandboxing of The New Apps</span></h3><span style="color: #444444;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Apps for Windows 8’s new Modern interface (formerly known as Metro) are sandboxed and restricted in what they can do on your computer.<br /><br />On the Windows desktop, applications had full access to your system. If you downloaded and ran a Windows game, it could install drivers on your system, read files from everywhere on your hard drive, and install malware on your computer. Even if programs&nbsp;run with limited credentials thanks to UAC, they typically install with Administrator privileges and can do anything they want during installation.<br /><br />Windows 8 apps function more like web pages and mobile apps on other popular mobile platforms. When you install an app from the Windows Store, that app has limited access to your system. It can’t run in the background and monitor all your keystrokes, logging your credit card number and online banking passwords like applications on the traditional Windows desktop can. it doesn’t have access to every file on your system.<br /><br />Apps for Windows 8’s new Modern interface are also only available through the Windows Store, which is more controversial. However, users can’t install malicious Modern apps from outside the store. They’d have to go through the Windows Store, where Microsoft has the ability to pull them if they’re discovered to be malicious.</span></span><br /><span style="color: #444444;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xDxx6SpC0Fc/UJy3rKzTpII/AAAAAAAABWw/wKRWCI-Hd-M/s1600/image35.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xDxx6SpC0Fc/UJy3rKzTpII/AAAAAAAABWw/wKRWCI-Hd-M/s1600/image35.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></span><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Smartscreen Filter</span></h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L2bA2tQjdgA/UJy35z6TlKI/AAAAAAAABW4/uv-0m-xpI2o/s1600/image47.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="175" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L2bA2tQjdgA/UJy35z6TlKI/AAAAAAAABW4/uv-0m-xpI2o/s400/image47.png" width="400" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #444444;">Previously used only in Internet Explorer, the SmartScreen filter is now implemented at the operating system-level. It will be used to scan EXE files you download from Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and other programs. When you download and double-click an EXE file, Windows will scan the file and send its signature to Microsoft’s servers. If the application is known-good, such as the installer for iTunes, Photoshop, or another popular program, Windows will allow it to run. If it’s known-bad, perhaps if it contains malware, Windows will prevent it from running. If it’s new and Windows doesn’t know what it is, Windows will warn you and allow you to bypass the warning.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #444444;">This feature should help less-experienced users from downloading and running malicious programs from the Internet. Even new pieces of malware will be detected by the SmartScreen filter as an unknown new program that should be approached with caution.</span></span><br /><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #444444;"><br /></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #444444;">So, the conclusion is that Windows 8 is&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;more secure than Windows 7.&nbsp;An integrated antivirus and application reputation system, along with a tamed app ecosystem that replaces the wild-west nature of previous versions of Windows, will probably make the most difference for inexperienced users that may not have ran an antivirus or knew which applications were safe to install on previous versions of Windows. Low-level improvements to the way Windows manages memory will help everyone, even power users like us!</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #444444;"><br /></span></span></div></div>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">It has not been all to long ago, <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/searcl/label/Google">Google</a> released Android 4.1.1 named Jelly Bean. If you want to check out all the main improvements in detail check out <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/2012/06/google-announces-android-41-jelly-bean.html">this article</a>. It's been the fastest and the most feature-rich Android OS till date. Though it's great to see these new technology already released, the update schedule to actually implement it on the broader level is rather unacceptable. Though it is now roughly around 3 months from the initial announcement of Jelly Bean at Google I/O, there are hardly any devices other than Nexus devices (Which receive updates directly from Google, of course!), that are running on Jelly Bean 4.1.1. Even there is a large number of Mid-range Android devices that are still waiting to receive Ice-Creme Sandwich 4.0.,&nbsp;and even those who do get the update might not see it until a year after Google released it, if not longer.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">So, if you're tired of waiting for the updates, and want to have a feel of Jelly Bean, you certainly can tweak your Gingerbread or ICS running Android's UI to get the visual feel of Jelly Bean. Though, to get the performance boost like Jelly Bean, you will have to wait longer, of course.&nbsp;So instead of waiting for either the update or a new phone, you can take advantage of some of the features it provides right on your current version by way of apps.</span><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Locker &amp; Launcher</span></h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zvUa7wMD_wU/UF6b7rtxj3I/AAAAAAAABTU/xLkumi3L-RY/s1600/locker.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zvUa7wMD_wU/UF6b7rtxj3I/AAAAAAAABTU/xLkumi3L-RY/s1600/locker.jpg" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The Launcher is not updated much in Jelly Bean from Ice Creme Sandwich. So, any Ice Creme Sandwich launcher will perfectly serve our purpose. In such case, you can opt for having <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobint.hololauncher">Holo Launcher</a> which is same as stock ICS/Jelly Bean Launcher.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MY0rBAcFMXU/UF6cLwCIMsI/AAAAAAAABTk/F_uPhQxgVmU/s1600/JB+live.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MY0rBAcFMXU/UF6cLwCIMsI/AAAAAAAABTk/F_uPhQxgVmU/s1600/JB+live.jpg" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Whereas, the same story gets repeated in the locker department as well. The locker is also kept unchanged. There is just a slight change in animation from ICS, nothing else. So, to have the locker same as Jelly Bean, you can opt for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobint.locker">Holo Locker</a>. It's 99% same as Stock Jelly Bean Locker.</span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Wallpapers</span></h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U3WPTRhpTcY/UF6cZ146FhI/AAAAAAAABTs/v9TXE2c6EUE/s1600/Screenshot_2012-09-23-10-15-56.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U3WPTRhpTcY/UF6cZ146FhI/AAAAAAAABTs/v9TXE2c6EUE/s640/Screenshot_2012-09-23-10-15-56.png" width="360" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">As said earlier, the Jelly Bean is more focused towards system performance rather than UI changes. So, it&nbsp;naively doesn't offer much of new Wallpapers from ICS, but still there are some worth considering.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">You can install Live wallpapers via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androidwasabi.livewallpaper.jellybean">this app</a> and Static Wallpapers via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kov.gallery.jellybean">this app</a>.&nbsp;</span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Status Bar</span></h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-juhQUfKFGUI/UF6cFoYeV5I/AAAAAAAABTc/i6pViS5s7Mo/s1600/Status+Bar.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-juhQUfKFGUI/UF6cFoYeV5I/AAAAAAAABTc/i6pViS5s7Mo/s1600/Status+Bar.jpg" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">To have a complete feel of Jelly Bean, you might want to change the status bar to that of Jelly Bean. There’s also <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.calsto.statusbar.jb">an app</a> which takes care of that for you, and includes a couple other customizations which make the app quite worthwhile.</span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Keyboard</span></h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mKWNunwoNNk/UF6c4h3_IYI/AAAAAAAABT0/B5dK9sSWsyA/s1600/Screenshot_2012-09-23-10-17-59.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mKWNunwoNNk/UF6c4h3_IYI/AAAAAAAABT0/B5dK9sSWsyA/s640/Screenshot_2012-09-23-10-17-59.png" width="360" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The major improvement for Android in Jelly Bean is it's keyboard. It's highly responsive ans well spaced out to grab your keystrokes smoothly and also it's prediction technique is awesome and saves lots of time typing long words. It's a must have app for any android device.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">You can download Jelly Bean Keyboard from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jellybeankeyboard.f.g">this link</a>. The only downside is that only ICS users can install it, so any Android 2.x user won't be able to use it. :(</span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Options For Rooted Devices</span></h3><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8TO9_KX52xk/UF6dW7ptdII/AAAAAAAABT8/WPBTVWh6jnU/s1600/CyanogenMod1.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8TO9_KX52xk/UF6dW7ptdII/AAAAAAAABT8/WPBTVWh6jnU/s320/CyanogenMod1.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Image Courtesy : <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/android/cyanogenmod-team-considers-deploying-proprietary-app-store-for-root-apps/" target="_blank">xda-Developers</a></td></tr></tbody></table><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">If you own a rooted device, then in my opinion, go for any custom ROM like Cyanogenmod (CM) to get the feel of the new OS rather than waiting for the official updates, which never come as promised if you own a device other than Nexus. Only Nexus devices gets updates faster than ever. So, waiting for the official update for a rooted device is not worth it. If you're rooted, you must have to be on ICS or Jelly Bean&nbsp;until&nbsp;now in my opinion. And if you're still stuck on Gingerbread, you might consider installing any Custom ROM that has support for your device. If you don't know whether your device is supported or not, just leave a comment for me, I'll surely help you out.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><br /></div></div>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Well, there has been a while when the Firefox OS came into light on <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1805282">XDA-Developers forums</a> of Galaxy Nexus. And now it seems like the development is gathering the&nbsp;pace. As an indicator of this, we've found a video of an ZTE Developer Smartphone running the early beta of the brand new Firefox OS.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">If you're curious about this brand new OS in the Smartphone Market, this video might satisfy your&nbsp;curiosity. Here it is,</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/5MzuGWFIfio?feature=player_detailpage" width="600"></iframe><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Though it might look like a clone of Android, but it's way different than that. Android is built on Java whereas Firefox is being built on HTML5. So, it's all together a different technology, and we're excited about it's developments and keen to cover all the major development of Firefox OS on TechnoTravel.in. Stay tuned!!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div>

	     <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-McsYNYawaME/UDHWAUhyBqI/AAAAAAAABRM/LYhX9HRxYaU/s1600/cloud_storage_2_web_0.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-McsYNYawaME/UDHWAUhyBqI/AAAAAAAABRM/LYhX9HRxYaU/s1600/cloud_storage_2_web_0.png" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Well, backups are essential and we've been told many times how important they are, although we may not pay attention to it until it's too late and we lose all our data! Though you can always backup your important data on your external physical hard drive,&nbsp;but free online backup services provide useful redundancy that could save your data big time!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">If you are a regular TechnoTravel.in reader, you may get this now that we're fan of <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/2012/08/pros-and-cons-of-cloud-basedonline-antivirus.html">cloud computing</a> and we will be writing numerous articles in coming future to let the world understand it's pros and cons. So, as a part of that effort, here we're mentioning out some useful and FREE websites, 15 to be precise, that offer free cloud storage space to let you backup, share or synchronize your data. Each of these services offers a free plan, most also having options for paid subscriptions that offer more storage space, and possibly additional features. Most of these services offer useful backup features such as automatic backups, scheduling, versioning, and restore features. Some services offer other useful features, such as the ability to access your backed up files anywhere using a browser or mobile apps and the ability to stream your media files to your mobile device.</span><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Microsoft SkyDrive</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/skydrive/home" target="_blank">Microsoft SkyDrive</a> offers 7GB of free data for the new subscribers. It used to offer 25GB in its initial stages, but now it's reduced down to 7GB. Though 7GB is also a good cloud storage space. The old subscribers, like me, are allowed to keep their 25GBs for free.</span></div><div><br /></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Store your files on SkyDrive and you can access them from your Android phone, iPhone, iPad, Windows phone in addition to your PC or Mac.&nbsp;Use SkyDrive to share large files and photos with your friends and family. They only need a web browser to access the files and photos.</span><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Though there are some drawbacks of SkyDrive that are worth mentioning here. Firstly, it&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;offer any considerable security to the files you upload, so if you are about to upload your sensitive data on SkyDrive, stop here. The other drawback is that it offers only one folder named SkyDrive, thus if you have data sorted out in many folders, you might find it difficult to upload it on SkyDrive.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">With 7 GB of free storage, SkyDrive is a good place to store your photos and other non-sensitive documents. Use other free backup services for your sensitive and private files. We mention which ones provide encryption for files uploaded to and retrieved from their service.</span><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9Eick34xGX4/UDHSVClEmVI/AAAAAAAABPU/Pr2qfk2ov9s/s1600/20-08-2012+10-05-48+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9Eick34xGX4/UDHSVClEmVI/AAAAAAAABPU/Pr2qfk2ov9s/s1600/20-08-2012+10-05-48+AM.png" /></a></div><div><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Box</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.box.com/" target="_blank">Box</a>&nbsp;is a good backup solution for the small but important files, as it offers 5GB of storage space with the file size limit of 100MB.&nbsp;The free account also allows you to create file sharing links and provides secure transfer and storage of your data. You can access your data anywhere, anytime, on any device, such as a desktop computer, a laptop, an iPhone, an iPad, or an Android device.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Organize your files online using folders just like you would on your desktop PC.

It allows you to&nbsp;backup your data to your friends, families, and colleague’s computers for free.

BuddyBackup also regularly checks that your buddies still have your backups. If there is a problem on a buddy’s computer, BuddyBackup automatically backs up your files to a different buddy instead. So, if one of your buddies uninstalls BuddyBackup or their computer fails, your data is still safe</span><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">You can also backup your data offline to your own external hard drives.<br /><br />If your computer crashes and you have to restore your data to a new computer, you can easily do so by running BuddyBackup on your new computer.

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z7mYAXIUzTA/UCnwYrCBqFI/AAAAAAAABNo/0OtquudE6pg/s1600/common-sprite+(1).png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z7mYAXIUzTA/UCnwYrCBqFI/AAAAAAAABNo/0OtquudE6pg/s1600/common-sprite+(1).png" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Well, instead of diving into OpenDNS thing&nbsp;straight&nbsp;away, we believe you might want to have a look at what DNS actually is? DNS is the abbreviated form of the term "Domain Name Server" (You can actually replace Server with Service or System as well!).</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The primary job of the DNS server is providing the ip address of the different websites to your computer. Which means, when you type www.google.com or www.yahoo.com in your browser address bar, your computer actually queries the DNS server which it is configured to use. In response to that query DNS server returns the ip address of that queried website, in this case say www.google.com. Thus DNS server will return the ip address of www.google.com's server. With the help of this ip address, your computer can finally reach to Google.com. Thus there is an important role of DNS server to let you access the internet from your PC.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">No matter what operating system you use, say <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/search/label/windows">Windows</a>, <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/search/label/Linux">Linux</a> or <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/search/label/iOS">Mac</a>, your computer have to have DNS server configured to be able to access the Internet. Now, by default, your ISP (Internet Service Provider) has their own DNS server in most cases. Thus up till now, if you haven't changed your DNS server ever, then you surely are running your ISP's DNS server.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Unfortunately, your DNS server can be the weakest link in the entire Internet Workflow. In a easy language, no matter how speedy or robust your internet link is, if the DNS server of your ISP is faulty or say tad slow, it can ruin your browsing experience. If the DNS server of your ISP is slow, it takes more time to reply to the query sent by your computer, resulting in the slowness of the rendering of the webpage. And in India, ISPs seems not to be too concerned about having a robust DNS server. Which means, even if your ISP provides you the speed of 2Mbps, it can feel like 1Mbps if your DNS server is running slow!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">To solve this problem,</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">We can always opt for any other DNS server which is faster and equipped with more robust features than your ISP's DNS server. There are plenty of fast DNS servers to choose from to use for your computer, but we like OpenDNS the most.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.opendns.com/" target="_blank">OpenDNS</a> is a dedicated DNS servers. Which directly means that the developer staff at OpenDNS is only focused on making their DNS server faster and more reliable, nothing else. OpenDNS dramatically speeds up your internet connection and also enhances your overall internet experience as you'll get this after reading the full post.</span><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">How To Get Started?</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">There is no need of any software or registration to avail yourself the benefits of OpenDNS. All you need to do is to change your computer's DNS servers with the following ip addresses:</span></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><ul><li>208.67.222.222&nbsp;</li><li>208.67.220.220</li></ul>Don't know how to change your computer's DNS server? <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/2011/08/how-to-change-dns-servers-for-fast.html" target="">Here</a> is the guide that might help you! <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/2011/08/how-to-change-dns-servers-for-fast.html" target="">How To Change DNS Server in Windows</a></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The whole process takes a few seconds but with this single step alone, you just made your computer safer and increased the overall browsing speed. Here's why: </span><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Unlike the DNS servers of your less reliable ISP, OpenDNS servers store the IP addresses of millions of websites in their cache so it would take less time to resolve your requests. So if you have asked for an IP address of a website that has been previously requested by another OpenDNS user, you will get the reply instantly.</span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oaBfZRblaSg/UCnxP8vAgUI/AAAAAAAABNw/6HbthGSKPuQ/s1600/opendns.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oaBfZRblaSg/UCnxP8vAgUI/AAAAAAAABNw/6HbthGSKPuQ/s1600/opendns.gif" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Another huge advantage of OpenDNS is that it prevents phishing sites that has ability to steal your important passwords from loading in your computer. Thus OpenDNS does the job which your normal antivirus can't do.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The another very good&nbsp;feature&nbsp;is Parental Control. If you enable this, you can actually prevent your kids from accessing porn sites using OpenDNS shield!

	     <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XtXwAqV0TfA/UCdfXfClXQI/AAAAAAAABLU/xLhx85rlsyo/s1600/blue_wifi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="168" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XtXwAqV0TfA/UCdfXfClXQI/AAAAAAAABLU/xLhx85rlsyo/s320/blue_wifi.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The modern home has broadband, smartphones, tablets, PCs and laptops. Naturally Wi-Fi has become a new buzzword in connectivity. Not only the technology that let you break away from wires, but it also allows different users to share internet connection. What's more, it has other purposes too, such as the ability to transfer files between devices, wirelessly print documents and more. So, if you're wondering how you can go wireless at home, read on...</span><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">But first, what is Wi-Fi?</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Wi-Fi or Wireless LAN (WLAN) is a standard that allows devices to communicate with each other using a Wi-Fi router as the central hub. All devices with Wi-Fi connect to the router via which data exchange take place. Depending on the router used and the surroundings conditions - such as walls, physical obstructions and other wireless networks in the vicinity - Wi-Fi routers can have a range of around 20-25 feet indoors.</span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">What Does 2.4GHz, 5GHz mean? Which one is Better?</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Each and every wireless network that you are surrounded with have its particular frequency to get itself&nbsp;propagated&nbsp;in. Means that each wireless transmitter has its pre-defined frequency range in which it can transmit signals. And this frequency ranges or bands must differ with each other, so that they doesn't mix-up themselves with other signals, which can be treated as noise. Noise is simply an unwanted signal which can destroy or manipulate your actual signal which results in information loss and the integrity of information can't be maintained.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The 2.4GHz sticker that you see on your Wi-Fi router is nothing but its frequency band. This means that it can transmit data at the frequency of 2.4GHz (Giga Hertz). This applies for 5GHz routers too.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Most gadgets nowadays use this 2.4GHz frequency to transmit the data. Now when there exist more than one Wi-Fi routers in a short distance, and if they both are transmitting at 2.4GHz, there lies the chances of network congestion and interference. This limitation lead us to the introduction of 5GHz frequency band, which, for now,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">is&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">less-crowded thus providing better transfer rate and less congestion.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">However the one fact that should be taken under consideration is the range of the above mentioned frequencies. Higher the frequency, the shorter its range. Which directly means that with 2.4GHz router you can transmit in a larger area compared to 5GHz, thus it needs less repeaters to transmit long distance. Though this both frequencies are higher enough which prevents them from penetrating the solid objects like walls, thus limiting their reach.</span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">What does Wi-Fi a/b/g/n mean?</span></h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RtpekIKmG5w/UCdh42nZd_I/AAAAAAAABLk/2MfZxG_XjYs/s1600/wifi-standards-a-b-g-n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RtpekIKmG5w/UCdh42nZd_I/AAAAAAAABLk/2MfZxG_XjYs/s1600/wifi-standards-a-b-g-n.jpg" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The Wi-Fi technology was introduces in 1997, with time, Wi-Fi has been updated with several new standards that enhances its functionality to match with the demand of the latest "bandwidth hungry" devices!</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Wi-Fi standards 'a' and 'b' are old standards and nearly non-existant. Both of these were introduced in the early days of Wi-Fi thus providing very low data transfer speeds, which is quite impractical in today's world of Fiber Internet.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Wi-Fi standard 'g' stands for the transmission of 2.4GHz frequency band. And it is the most common standard used these days. It has the theoretical maximum transfer rate of 54Mbps, and it is more tolerant to the signal interference that previous ones.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Wi-Fi standard 'n' is the latest of the lot which supports a whooping 300Mbps of speed. The latest laptops and smartphones/tablets are well equipped to support Wi-Fi 'n'. It can use either 2.4Ghz or 5GHz frequency. It also provides better signal strength due to improved signal intensity, but it is more prone to signal interference.</span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Dual Band or Single Band?</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">There exists three type of routers: Single Band, dual band and simultaneous dual band.</span></div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Single Band</b> routers operate at the single frequency of 2.4GHz and do not support 5GHz frequency at all.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Dual Band</b> support both, 2.4GHz &amp; 5GHz, frequency bands, but can work with only one at a time. Means, if you are operating that router with 2.4GHz band, it won't be able to connect with 5GHz frequency.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Simultaneous dual-band</b> routers removes the limitations of both above mentioned routers, means it can work with both bands at the same time, providing more flexibility and speed.</span></li></ul><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">ADSL/DSL + Wi-Fi Routers?</span></h3></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iRKVPzPoYdc/UCdgWuM6SDI/AAAAAAAABLc/VDJMtaiOwOU/s1600/wifi-router.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iRKVPzPoYdc/UCdgWuM6SDI/AAAAAAAABLc/VDJMtaiOwOU/s1600/wifi-router.jpg" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">ADSL and DSL technology is used to provide broadband connectivity to the households. Normally, a phone line wire is inserted into a DSL or ADSL modem, via which your broadband connection works.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Wi-Fi routers with built-in ADSL or DSL modem can be purchased, thus eliminating the need for&nbsp;separate&nbsp;modem or router. However, it is recommended to use a&nbsp;separate&nbsp;modem and Wi-Fi router, since it turns out to be more cheaper and better. Most Wi-Fi routers with built in modem lack several features unless you shell out some more bucks, and they can get unstable under heavy usage due to the excess heat generation.</span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Security Matters!</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">If left open or&nbsp;unprotected, your Wi-Fi network is open to all allowing your neighbours to use broadband for free without your knowledge! Thus it is always advisable to protect your Wi-Fi with password to prevent any misuse. Besides, Indian government has made it mandatory that every Wi-Fi network has to be password protected so as to prevent terrorist from using it.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">A simple and effective way of protecting a Wi-Fi network is by hiding its name, known as SSID (Server Set Identifier) - that is, the router will not show up when someone seeks a connection to it. Thus if no one can see it, no one will access it! Simple as that. But one drawback of this is that you will have to enter your Wi-Fi's name every time you want to connect, which can be cumbersome at times.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">While modern Wi-Fi routers comes with tons of security modes to protect network, the most common are WEP, WPA, WPA 2. Of this, WPA 2 (WiFi protected access 2) is the most advanced, secure and common protocol out there, and is&nbsp;mandatory&nbsp;on all routers after 2005.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The WPA2-Enterprise mode has advanced security, but it is not recommended for home or small office purpose.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">[Image Credits : <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/academics/CCC/Netops/Wireless/11n.html" target="_blank">www.wpi.edu</a>, <a href="http://soc-sec.net/2011/07/04/wi-fi-security-confuses-most-users/blue_wifi/" target="_blank">soc-sec.net</a>, <a href="http://www.prepaid-wireless-guide.com/prepaid-wifi.html" target="_blank">prepaid-wireless-guide.com</a>]</span></div></div>

My personal favorite feature of any Nexus device is its superiority in getting the updates of the latest Android versions as soon as they are launched. And I also hate the bloatwares, so nexus devices comes in handy for that purpose too! (Though you can remove bloatware from the non-nexus devices with root&nbsp;privileges, but Vanilla Android is a class apart!)</span><br /><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The above statements were from the Nexus lover in me, so now we'll review the latest Nexus Device a unique way. What we've done here is that we've made a collection of the review videos from the trusted and pioneer in their own categories uploaders. Here we are sharing a collection of 8 YouTube videos from the&nbsp;renowned uploaders like Pocket Now, The Verge, PhoneArena, CNET, Mommy Loves Tech, Mobile Tech Review, The BGR Show and The Gadgate Show.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">After watching these videos, we hope that you will be able to make up your mind on whether to buy Google Nexus 7 or not!</span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Pocket Now</b></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The video from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/pocketnowvideo" target="_blank">Pocketnow</a> is brief but informative enough to have you an overview on the Google Nexus 7.

In summing up Josh Topolsky calls the Nexus 7 “incredible,” not only at this $199 price point, but at any price point. He falls short of suggesting you buy this over an iPad, but only because developers need to start taking Android tablets seriously.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/EPLpHev1YnQ?feature=player_embedded" width="540"></iframe><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>CNET</b></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/CNETTV" target="_blank">CNET</a> only hives the brief overview, but it is still worth watching.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Y9odwaX2MGo?feature=player_embedded" width="540"></iframe><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>The Gadgate Show</b></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/thegadgetshow">The Gadget Show</a> offers up a short-but-sweet video review mostly filled with facts rather than opinion. According to the reviewer the Nexus 7 “is small, relatively cheap, and offers great performance.” They also suggest this tablet is “terrific value for money” despite the aforementioned lack of expandable memory or support for Flash. </span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div><br /><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Mommy Loves Tech</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MXqE0cbdock?feature=player_embedded" width="540"></iframe><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Mobile Tech Review</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/RyowcldPXCo?feature=player_embedded" width="540"></iframe><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>PhoneArena</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vp3Otpdrf1Q?feature=player_embedded" width="540"></iframe><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>The BGR Show</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jlNfUUgJ0IQ?feature=player_embedded" width="540"></iframe><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Conclusion</b></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444;"><br /></span></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">There we have it, eight video reviews of the Nexus 7 from a mixed range of sources. Some are long, some are short… some offer nothing but a brief overview of the device while some offer deep insights of both the hardware and software. All offer an opinion – hopefully an honest and unbiased one – that could and should help you decide whether to buy the Google nexus 7 or not.<br /><br />Have you already purchased the Nexus 7? If so, what do you think of it? If not, is it something you’re considering buying in the near future? What is holding you back from making the final decision to place your money down? Are you just a happy iPad owner who really doesn’t see the appeal of this young pretender? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below.</span><br /><div><br /></div></div>

	     <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ut46vjXzplw/UB_FHuKT9XI/AAAAAAAABEY/RpOK25aaG9Y/s1600/4563333631_f591224f44_z.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ut46vjXzplw/UB_FHuKT9XI/AAAAAAAABEY/RpOK25aaG9Y/s320/4563333631_f591224f44_z.jpg" width="214" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption">Image Courtsy : <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/35187757@N04/4563333631/" target="_blank">Flickr</a> by&nbsp;<span id="goog_1094094011"></span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/35187757@N04/" target="_blank">Walhecke</a><span id="goog_1094094012"></span></td></tr></tbody></table><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Well, the fiber optic technology is amazing and there are no doubts about that. And it's already in action at Kensas city where <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/2012/07/google-launches-crazy-1000mbps-fiber-internet-today.html" target="_blank">Google launched crazy 1000 Mbps Fiber Internet</a> using this Optical Fiber Technology. But ever wondered what this optical fiber technology actually is?</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">One thing that we can get with this "optical" word that there must be light that is involved in this revolutionary technology. And if you guessed that, you're absolutely right. It's about converting the source of information, which is usually in electrical form, to the form of light before transmitting it to the fiber (The cable which carries light in it!). Now the another question might strike to your mind that what about the unbelievable speed that it supports? Well, the logic is quite clear. As we all know, the light travels at the speed of 300000 km/sec which is faster than our imagination. And as we're converting our information signal to light, it's quite obvious that it will travel at the speed of light to provide us such high bandwidth.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">So at the note of this, we've a YouTube video uploaded and made by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/engineerguyvideo?feature=g-user-c" target="_blank">engineerguyvideo</a> which explains the work of Fiber Optic Cables in a very easy manner. Enjoy the video.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0MwMkBET_5I?feature=player_detailpage" width="545"></iframe><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">If you really liked the video, take couple of minutes to subcribe to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/engineerguyvideo?feature=g-user-c" target="_blank">engineerguyvideo</a>, as this engineer has tons of video to show you how things work! Personally, I'm fan of him and I'm doing my bit to promote his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/engineerguyvideo?feature=g-user-c" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a>.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div>
