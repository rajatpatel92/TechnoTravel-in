	     <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-McsYNYawaME/UDHWAUhyBqI/AAAAAAAABRM/LYhX9HRxYaU/s1600/cloud_storage_2_web_0.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-McsYNYawaME/UDHWAUhyBqI/AAAAAAAABRM/LYhX9HRxYaU/s1600/cloud_storage_2_web_0.png" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Well, backups are essential and we've been told many times how important they are, although we may not pay attention to it until it's too late and we lose all our data! Though you can always backup your important data on your external physical hard drive,&nbsp;but free online backup services provide useful redundancy that could save your data big time!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">If you are a regular TechnoTravel.in reader, you may get this now that we're fan of <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/2012/08/pros-and-cons-of-cloud-basedonline-antivirus.html">cloud computing</a> and we will be writing numerous articles in coming future to let the world understand it's pros and cons. So, as a part of that effort, here we're mentioning out some useful and FREE websites, 15 to be precise, that offer free cloud storage space to let you backup, share or synchronize your data. Each of these services offers a free plan, most also having options for paid subscriptions that offer more storage space, and possibly additional features. Most of these services offer useful backup features such as automatic backups, scheduling, versioning, and restore features. Some services offer other useful features, such as the ability to access your backed up files anywhere using a browser or mobile apps and the ability to stream your media files to your mobile device.</span><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Microsoft SkyDrive</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/skydrive/home" target="_blank">Microsoft SkyDrive</a> offers 7GB of free data for the new subscribers. It used to offer 25GB in its initial stages, but now it's reduced down to 7GB. Though 7GB is also a good cloud storage space. The old subscribers, like me, are allowed to keep their 25GBs for free.</span></div><div><br /></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Store your files on SkyDrive and you can access them from your Android phone, iPhone, iPad, Windows phone in addition to your PC or Mac.&nbsp;Use SkyDrive to share large files and photos with your friends and family. They only need a web browser to access the files and photos.</span><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Though there are some drawbacks of SkyDrive that are worth mentioning here. Firstly, it&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;offer any considerable security to the files you upload, so if you are about to upload your sensitive data on SkyDrive, stop here. The other drawback is that it offers only one folder named SkyDrive, thus if you have data sorted out in many folders, you might find it difficult to upload it on SkyDrive.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">With 7 GB of free storage, SkyDrive is a good place to store your photos and other non-sensitive documents. Use other free backup services for your sensitive and private files. We mention which ones provide encryption for files uploaded to and retrieved from their service.</span><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9Eick34xGX4/UDHSVClEmVI/AAAAAAAABPU/Pr2qfk2ov9s/s1600/20-08-2012+10-05-48+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9Eick34xGX4/UDHSVClEmVI/AAAAAAAABPU/Pr2qfk2ov9s/s1600/20-08-2012+10-05-48+AM.png" /></a></div><div><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Box</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.box.com/" target="_blank">Box</a>&nbsp;is a good backup solution for the small but important files, as it offers 5GB of storage space with the file size limit of 100MB.&nbsp;The free account also allows you to create file sharing links and provides secure transfer and storage of your data. You can access your data anywhere, anytime, on any device, such as a desktop computer, a laptop, an iPhone, an iPad, or an Android device.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Organize your files online using folders just like you would on your desktop PC. Edit your documents online and save them directly back into your Box account using your native desktop applications.&nbsp;Use Box to share large files easily, rather than trying to email big files, such as videos or presentations.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">If you need more than 5 GB of storage space, you can <a href="https://www.box.com/pricing/">upgrade your account</a> to 25 GB of space for $9.99 per month, or 50 GB of space for $19.99 per month. Both of these plans also increases the maximum file size to 1 GB. Business and Enterprise plans are also available.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zAi1Hd63YG8/UDHSuhHtm0I/AAAAAAAABPc/gzy0f6a9Yo4/s1600/20-08-2012+10-20-16+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zAi1Hd63YG8/UDHSuhHtm0I/AAAAAAAABPc/gzy0f6a9Yo4/s1600/20-08-2012+10-20-16+AM.png" /></a></div><div><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">ADrive</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.adrive.com/" target="_blank">ADrive</a> offers a personal basic plan that offers 50GB of free cloud storage and features allows you to&nbsp;backup, share, access, and edit your data from anywhere you have Internet access.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Share large files with family and friends using ADrive’s File Sharing feature. You can get a unique link for a file you want to share in an email. Simply email that link to anyone with whom you want to share that file. If you don’t want to share a file anymore, you can “unshare” it as well.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">You can also edit your word processing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations online. Open, edit, and save your documents directly from within your ADrive account online.<br /><br />Use ADrive’s convenient search tool to find files you want to access or restore without having to browse through all your directories and files.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RCP22X90_Uk/UDHS4THnIkI/AAAAAAAABPk/Fmq_OVvTJwE/s1600/20-08-2012+10-19-05+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RCP22X90_Uk/UDHS4THnIkI/AAAAAAAABPk/Fmq_OVvTJwE/s1600/20-08-2012+10-19-05+AM.png" /></a></div><div><div><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Comodo Backup</span></h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://backup.comodo.com/">Comodo Backup</a> offers 5 GB of free online backup space and a free, lifetime license. Backup your data to  Stream music and videos from and edit documents directly in your online account.<br /><br />Files you choose to backup are encrypted before they leave your computer and are stored encrypted on Comodo’s servers or other storage media you select.

With a free account, you get unmetered bandwidth, unattended, or automatic, backup, and AES 128-bit encryption and HTTPS (SSL) connections.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xYCgTzORlEM/UDHTSsMl8oI/AAAAAAAABP0/zR8hIE0j1H8/s1600/20-08-2012+11-09-22+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xYCgTzORlEM/UDHTSsMl8oI/AAAAAAAABP0/zR8hIE0j1H8/s1600/20-08-2012+11-09-22+AM.png" /></a></div><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">BuddyBackup</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.buddybackup.com/" target="_blank">Buddy Backup</a> has an interesting concept. It allows you to&nbsp;backup your data to your friends, families, and colleague’s computers for free. All backed up files are encrypted locally before they are sent to your buddies’ machines and only you have the encryption keys. So, your buddies can’t read your files.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">You don’t have to worry about your backups staying on your buddies’ computers. You can setup BuddyBackup to backup multiple copies of your files, so you’re sure you have backups. Two copies of your data are spread among your buddies by default. BuddyBackup also regularly checks that your buddies still have your backups. If there is a problem on a buddy’s computer, BuddyBackup automatically backs up your files to a different buddy instead. So, if one of your buddies uninstalls BuddyBackup or their computer fails, your data is still safe</span><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">You can also backup your data offline to your own external hard drives.<br /><br />If your computer crashes and you have to restore your data to a new computer, you can easily do so by running BuddyBackup on your new computer. You can also recover your files from a friend’s computer, if you haven’t replaced your computer yet, using the Guest Mode. In Guest Mode, you can’t add to backups; you can only restore files from existing backups.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EJGH6RQiPcM/UDHTf24_H6I/AAAAAAAABP8/_XQN8FSazLY/s1600/20-08-2012+11-11-28+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EJGH6RQiPcM/UDHTf24_H6I/AAAAAAAABP8/_XQN8FSazLY/s1600/20-08-2012+11-11-28+AM.png" /></a></div><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">DropBox</span></h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/pricing">Dropbox</a> offers 2 GB of storage for free, and the ability to sync files and folders between your Windows, Mac, or Linux computer and the cloud.

Clients for PC and Mac are available for download that you can set up to perform fully automated backups. Select folders to be backed up, set a schedule, and Mozy will keep a backup of these folders online, regularly syncing them without interaction from you. Mozy also provides military-grade encryption prior to transfer using a secure SSL connection.<br /><br />Once you perform your initial backup of your files, Mozy saves bandwidth by only backing up new or changed portions of files, helping to speed up future backups. Mozy also backs up all open and locked files, such as Outlook PST files. You can schedule backups to happen while your computer is on but not in use. Backups can occur daily or weekly at a specific time of day.<br /><br />When you need to restore your data, you can choose to do so using the software client, on the web, or by ordering a DVD to restore. If you’re using Windows, you can also restore your data using the right-click context menu or through the Mozy Virtual Drive. You can restore file versions up to 30 days into the past.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rwA86PAdYmY/UDHT_OQKyMI/AAAAAAAABQU/Yi9i8FTs1j8/s1600/20-08-2012+11-16-36+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rwA86PAdYmY/UDHT_OQKyMI/AAAAAAAABQU/Yi9i8FTs1j8/s1600/20-08-2012+11-16-36+AM.png" /></a></div><div><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">MiMedia</span></h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.mimedia.com/">MiMedia</a> offers 7 GB of storage space for free, and features such as secure, automatic online backup and cloud sync.

You can use SugarSync not only as an online backup service, but also as a way to sync your files, such as music and photos, among your computers and other devices, such as your Android device, iPhone, iPad, BlackBerry, and Kindle Fire. SugarSync can be handy if you need to transfer files between a PC and a Mac.<br /><br />Just like Mozy, you can backup your data from any folders on your hard drive. You can also select folders to share with your friends and family. You can edit files on your computer while it’s offline, and the changed files are quietly synced with SugarSync the next time your computer is online without interfering with your productivity.<br /><br />SugarSync keeps the previous five versions of all your files so you can reference or restore them in the future. Only the most recent version of each file counts against your storage limit.<br /><br />If you just want to backup a set of files without automatically syncing them or updating them, you can use SugarSync’s Web Archive feature. Everything stored in the Web Archive is accessible from the web and your mobile devices.<br /><br />SugarSync offers mobile apps for devices such as Android, iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, BlackBerry, and Windows Mobile. You can access files backed up to your SugarSync account from any of your other computers, share photos, upload files and photos of any size from your mobile device to your computer (even if it’s turned off), and even edit documents, depending upon the capabilities of your device.<br /><br />Data uploaded to and retrieved from SugarSync’s servers are sent over the Internet using TLS (SSL 3.3) encryption. Every piece of information moved between your computers, mobile devices, and SugarSync’s servers is verified as a secure communication, whether you are backing up files to their servers or restoring files from them. You can also protect folders you share with other people, such as clients or coworkers.<br /><br />SugarSync offers some handy features for transferring music and photos between your mobile devices and your computers. You can also stream music to your mobile device. For Android devices and iPhones, you can sync your music to your phone so you can listen to it offline. Share a large video file by sending a link to the file rather than sending an email with a large attachment.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DKUPEZuvOu4/UDHUit9xr7I/AAAAAAAABQs/B6M5dmFB0ek/s1600/20-08-2012+11-20-46+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DKUPEZuvOu4/UDHUit9xr7I/AAAAAAAABQs/B6M5dmFB0ek/s1600/20-08-2012+11-20-46+AM.png" /></a></div><div><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">ElephantDrive</span></h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://home.elephantdrive.com/plans-and-pricing/free-plans/">ElephantDrive’s Lite Edition</a> plan offers 2 GB of free online backup space and has all the features of ElephantDrive’s premium plans, including automatic online storage and backup, military-grade encryption, and support for up to three computers or devices.

If a backup is interrupted, it is resumed the next time the computers become available again.<br /><br />When you backup data to multiple destinations, your data is sent to one destination one at a time. To make sure you have a full backup as soon as possible, the order of your backups is based on which destination will complete first.<br /><br />With the free version of CrashPlan, your files are secured before they are transferred to CrashPlan’s servers using enterprise-grade, 128-bit encryption. Paid plans provide 448-bit encryption.<br /><br />There are no limitations on the size of files you can backup.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m8Op9OAwbC4/UDHU9LdRdZI/AAAAAAAABQ8/t1vwlLVwGXg/s1600/20-08-2012+11-25-23+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m8Op9OAwbC4/UDHU9LdRdZI/AAAAAAAABQ8/t1vwlLVwGXg/s1600/20-08-2012+11-25-23+AM.png" /></a></div><div><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Ubuntu One</span></h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="https://one.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu One</a> allows you to sync up to 5 GB of files to the cloud for free and access it anywhere.

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z7mYAXIUzTA/UCnwYrCBqFI/AAAAAAAABNo/0OtquudE6pg/s1600/common-sprite+(1).png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z7mYAXIUzTA/UCnwYrCBqFI/AAAAAAAABNo/0OtquudE6pg/s1600/common-sprite+(1).png" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Well, instead of diving into OpenDNS thing&nbsp;straight&nbsp;away, we believe you might want to have a look at what DNS actually is? DNS is the abbreviated form of the term "Domain Name Server" (You can actually replace Server with Service or System as well!).</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The primary job of the DNS server is providing the ip address of the different websites to your computer. Which means, when you type www.google.com or www.yahoo.com in your browser address bar, your computer actually queries the DNS server which it is configured to use. In response to that query DNS server returns the ip address of that queried website, in this case say www.google.com. Thus DNS server will return the ip address of www.google.com's server. With the help of this ip address, your computer can finally reach to Google.com. Thus there is an important role of DNS server to let you access the internet from your PC.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">No matter what operating system you use, say <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/search/label/windows">Windows</a>, <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/search/label/Linux">Linux</a> or <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/search/label/iOS">Mac</a>, your computer have to have DNS server configured to be able to access the Internet. Now, by default, your ISP (Internet Service Provider) has their own DNS server in most cases. Thus up till now, if you haven't changed your DNS server ever, then you surely are running your ISP's DNS server.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Unfortunately, your DNS server can be the weakest link in the entire Internet Workflow. In a easy language, no matter how speedy or robust your internet link is, if the DNS server of your ISP is faulty or say tad slow, it can ruin your browsing experience. If the DNS server of your ISP is slow, it takes more time to reply to the query sent by your computer, resulting in the slowness of the rendering of the webpage. And in India, ISPs seems not to be too concerned about having a robust DNS server. Which means, even if your ISP provides you the speed of 2Mbps, it can feel like 1Mbps if your DNS server is running slow!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">To solve this problem,</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">We can always opt for any other DNS server which is faster and equipped with more robust features than your ISP's DNS server. There are plenty of fast DNS servers to choose from to use for your computer, but we like OpenDNS the most.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.opendns.com/" target="_blank">OpenDNS</a> is a dedicated DNS servers. Which directly means that the developer staff at OpenDNS is only focused on making their DNS server faster and more reliable, nothing else. OpenDNS dramatically speeds up your internet connection and also enhances your overall internet experience as you'll get this after reading the full post.</span><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">How To Get Started?</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">There is no need of any software or registration to avail yourself the benefits of OpenDNS. All you need to do is to change your computer's DNS servers with the following ip addresses:</span></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><ul><li>208.67.222.222&nbsp;</li><li>208.67.220.220</li></ul>Don't know how to change your computer's DNS server? <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/2011/08/how-to-change-dns-servers-for-fast.html" target="">Here</a> is the guide that might help you! <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/2011/08/how-to-change-dns-servers-for-fast.html" target="">How To Change DNS Server in Windows</a></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The whole process takes a few seconds but with this single step alone, you just made your computer safer and increased the overall browsing speed. Here's why: </span><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Unlike the DNS servers of your less reliable ISP, OpenDNS servers store the IP addresses of millions of websites in their cache so it would take less time to resolve your requests. So if you have asked for an IP address of a website that has been previously requested by another OpenDNS user, you will get the reply instantly.</span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oaBfZRblaSg/UCnxP8vAgUI/AAAAAAAABNw/6HbthGSKPuQ/s1600/opendns.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oaBfZRblaSg/UCnxP8vAgUI/AAAAAAAABNw/6HbthGSKPuQ/s1600/opendns.gif" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Another huge advantage of OpenDNS is that it prevents phishing sites that has ability to steal your important passwords from loading in your computer. Thus OpenDNS does the job which your normal antivirus can't do.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The another very good&nbsp;feature&nbsp;is Parental Control. If you enable this, you can actually prevent your kids from accessing porn sites using OpenDNS shield! There are another plenty of features included in the OpenDNS like Solving Typo Errors, Shortcuts for your favorite sites and many more.</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-s3RfsaRLXqM/UCnxeNMyVYI/AAAAAAAABN4/O6GX8lE3mD0/s1600/14-08-2012+11-37-25+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-s3RfsaRLXqM/UCnxeNMyVYI/AAAAAAAABN4/O6GX8lE3mD0/s1600/14-08-2012+11-37-25+AM.png" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Thus in many ways, OpenDNS is a very useful and easy to set-up DNS server to enhance your overall internet browsing experience.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">So why wait? Get started here&nbsp;<a href="http://www.opendns.com/">www.opendns.com</a></span></div><div><br /></div></div>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XtXwAqV0TfA/UCdfXfClXQI/AAAAAAAABLU/xLhx85rlsyo/s1600/blue_wifi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="168" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XtXwAqV0TfA/UCdfXfClXQI/AAAAAAAABLU/xLhx85rlsyo/s320/blue_wifi.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The modern home has broadband, smartphones, tablets, PCs and laptops. Naturally Wi-Fi has become a new buzzword in connectivity. Not only the technology that let you break away from wires, but it also allows different users to share internet connection. What's more, it has other purposes too, such as the ability to transfer files between devices, wirelessly print documents and more. So, if you're wondering how you can go wireless at home, read on...</span><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">But first, what is Wi-Fi?</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Wi-Fi or Wireless LAN (WLAN) is a standard that allows devices to communicate with each other using a Wi-Fi router as the central hub. All devices with Wi-Fi connect to the router via which data exchange take place. Depending on the router used and the surroundings conditions - such as walls, physical obstructions and other wireless networks in the vicinity - Wi-Fi routers can have a range of around 20-25 feet indoors.</span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">What Does 2.4GHz, 5GHz mean? Which one is Better?</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Each and every wireless network that you are surrounded with have its particular frequency to get itself&nbsp;propagated&nbsp;in. Means that each wireless transmitter has its pre-defined frequency range in which it can transmit signals. And this frequency ranges or bands must differ with each other, so that they doesn't mix-up themselves with other signals, which can be treated as noise. Noise is simply an unwanted signal which can destroy or manipulate your actual signal which results in information loss and the integrity of information can't be maintained.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The 2.4GHz sticker that you see on your Wi-Fi router is nothing but its frequency band. This means that it can transmit data at the frequency of 2.4GHz (Giga Hertz). This applies for 5GHz routers too.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Most gadgets nowadays use this 2.4GHz frequency to transmit the data. Now when there exist more than one Wi-Fi routers in a short distance, and if they both are transmitting at 2.4GHz, there lies the chances of network congestion and interference. This limitation lead us to the introduction of 5GHz frequency band, which, for now,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">is&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">less-crowded thus providing better transfer rate and less congestion.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">However the one fact that should be taken under consideration is the range of the above mentioned frequencies. Higher the frequency, the shorter its range. Which directly means that with 2.4GHz router you can transmit in a larger area compared to 5GHz, thus it needs less repeaters to transmit long distance. Though this both frequencies are higher enough which prevents them from penetrating the solid objects like walls, thus limiting their reach.</span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">What does Wi-Fi a/b/g/n mean?</span></h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RtpekIKmG5w/UCdh42nZd_I/AAAAAAAABLk/2MfZxG_XjYs/s1600/wifi-standards-a-b-g-n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RtpekIKmG5w/UCdh42nZd_I/AAAAAAAABLk/2MfZxG_XjYs/s1600/wifi-standards-a-b-g-n.jpg" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The Wi-Fi technology was introduces in 1997, with time, Wi-Fi has been updated with several new standards that enhances its functionality to match with the demand of the latest "bandwidth hungry" devices!</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Wi-Fi standards 'a' and 'b' are old standards and nearly non-existant. Both of these were introduced in the early days of Wi-Fi thus providing very low data transfer speeds, which is quite impractical in today's world of Fiber Internet.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Wi-Fi standard 'g' stands for the transmission of 2.4GHz frequency band. And it is the most common standard used these days. It has the theoretical maximum transfer rate of 54Mbps, and it is more tolerant to the signal interference that previous ones.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Wi-Fi standard 'n' is the latest of the lot which supports a whooping 300Mbps of speed. The latest laptops and smartphones/tablets are well equipped to support Wi-Fi 'n'. It can use either 2.4Ghz or 5GHz frequency. It also provides better signal strength due to improved signal intensity, but it is more prone to signal interference.</span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Dual Band or Single Band?</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">There exists three type of routers: Single Band, dual band and simultaneous dual band.</span></div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Single Band</b> routers operate at the single frequency of 2.4GHz and do not support 5GHz frequency at all.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Dual Band</b> support both, 2.4GHz &amp; 5GHz, frequency bands, but can work with only one at a time. Means, if you are operating that router with 2.4GHz band, it won't be able to connect with 5GHz frequency.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Simultaneous dual-band</b> routers removes the limitations of both above mentioned routers, means it can work with both bands at the same time, providing more flexibility and speed.</span></li></ul><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">ADSL/DSL + Wi-Fi Routers?</span></h3></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iRKVPzPoYdc/UCdgWuM6SDI/AAAAAAAABLc/VDJMtaiOwOU/s1600/wifi-router.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iRKVPzPoYdc/UCdgWuM6SDI/AAAAAAAABLc/VDJMtaiOwOU/s1600/wifi-router.jpg" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">ADSL and DSL technology is used to provide broadband connectivity to the households. Normally, a phone line wire is inserted into a DSL or ADSL modem, via which your broadband connection works.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Wi-Fi routers with built-in ADSL or DSL modem can be purchased, thus eliminating the need for&nbsp;separate&nbsp;modem or router. However, it is recommended to use a&nbsp;separate&nbsp;modem and Wi-Fi router, since it turns out to be more cheaper and better. Most Wi-Fi routers with built in modem lack several features unless you shell out some more bucks, and they can get unstable under heavy usage due to the excess heat generation.</span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Security Matters!</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">If left open or&nbsp;unprotected, your Wi-Fi network is open to all allowing your neighbours to use broadband for free without your knowledge! Thus it is always advisable to protect your Wi-Fi with password to prevent any misuse. Besides, Indian government has made it mandatory that every Wi-Fi network has to be password protected so as to prevent terrorist from using it.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">A simple and effective way of protecting a Wi-Fi network is by hiding its name, known as SSID (Server Set Identifier) - that is, the router will not show up when someone seeks a connection to it. Thus if no one can see it, no one will access it! Simple as that. But one drawback of this is that you will have to enter your Wi-Fi's name every time you want to connect, which can be cumbersome at times.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">While modern Wi-Fi routers comes with tons of security modes to protect network, the most common are WEP, WPA, WPA 2. Of this, WPA 2 (WiFi protected access 2) is the most advanced, secure and common protocol out there, and is&nbsp;mandatory&nbsp;on all routers after 2005.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The WPA2-Enterprise mode has advanced security, but it is not recommended for home or small office purpose.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">[Image Credits : <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/academics/CCC/Netops/Wireless/11n.html" target="_blank">www.wpi.edu</a>, <a href="http://soc-sec.net/2011/07/04/wi-fi-security-confuses-most-users/blue_wifi/" target="_blank">soc-sec.net</a>, <a href="http://www.prepaid-wireless-guide.com/prepaid-wifi.html" target="_blank">prepaid-wireless-guide.com</a>]</span></div></div>

And as we go through our initial checking period, we weren't disappointed. In fact, we're pleased to see such a beautiful web app.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">You can sign into Pulse either via Facebook or via their own account. As you sign in for first time, it'll ask you for your interests. There are plenty of options to choose from, just click your interests and done! You are good to go!</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tSmXKZOdnns/UCSdTvLMDuI/AAAAAAAABJs/uHplkjstvrc/s1600/10-08-2012+10-15-25+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tSmXKZOdnns/UCSdTvLMDuI/AAAAAAAABJs/uHplkjstvrc/s1600/10-08-2012+10-15-25+AM.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Pulse's user interface is very refreshing as it reminds me of the interface of Windows 8's Metro UI. It seems similar to Metro UI (Or whatever Microsoft will choose it's name!) with the different style of tiles full of high quality images. And with the dark background, same as Android App, it feels like a real eye-candy. I personally liked the dark background on their <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/search/label/Android">Android</a> App, and I liked it here, too. If you don't like the different-sized tiles, then you can always arrange them in a same order from the top-right menu.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TpKosy9Mz1Q/UCSdlLR87gI/AAAAAAAABJ0/vnLz9a0U4qA/s1600/10-08-2012+10-19-58+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TpKosy9Mz1Q/UCSdlLR87gI/AAAAAAAABJ0/vnLz9a0U4qA/s1600/10-08-2012+10-19-58+AM.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">To read the particular story, you need to click the image thumbnail and the story will pop-up. This is very&nbsp;minimalist UI and highly focused on the content to provide you best reading experience.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pXneslFeRQQ/UCSeIiP4KkI/AAAAAAAABKE/GSRGhyNCxbc/s1600/10-08-2012+10-24-24+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pXneslFeRQQ/UCSeIiP4KkI/AAAAAAAABKE/GSRGhyNCxbc/s1600/10-08-2012+10-24-24+AM.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The default fonts are very smooth and feels very easy on the eye, though if you don't like it, there are some options in the left bar to customize it as per your need. You can change toggle the background between dark and light, and you can change the fonts as well.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F25DFDwSeSU/UCSdvVaV2AI/AAAAAAAABJ8/nzFgDHdNs60/s1600/10-08-2012+10-25-17+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F25DFDwSeSU/UCSdvVaV2AI/AAAAAAAABJ8/nzFgDHdNs60/s1600/10-08-2012+10-25-17+AM.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The left bar on the reader pop-up also contains the quick share buttons to share the story to your friends and followers. You can always add content in your Pulse. Just click "Add Content" to bring the pop-up from the right to add the content easily. Though one drawback here is that you can't add the custom feeds on your own. Though there are plenty of resources to choose from, but we feel these feature missing from Pulse that the developers should focus upon.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0nDmZEY8vmY/UCSeRiyrHMI/AAAAAAAABKM/NLajuW7iOH0/s1600/10-08-2012+10-48-14+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0nDmZEY8vmY/UCSeRiyrHMI/AAAAAAAABKM/NLajuW7iOH0/s1600/10-08-2012+10-48-14+AM.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Other than this, we didn't find any bug, and performance vise it feels very smooth on Google Chrome. One thing you might notice that besides being such an image-heavy site, it loads up surprisingly fast that adds to it usefulness.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">From my personal point-of-view, I'll be using this app right away as I love its interface and speed.

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-q57Wi6nJKZg/UCPo45TDzpI/AAAAAAAABIY/RaOBWtF1kZE/s1600/chrome-logo-2011-04-27.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-q57Wi6nJKZg/UCPo45TDzpI/AAAAAAAABIY/RaOBWtF1kZE/s1600/chrome-logo-2011-04-27.jpg" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Though the Internet Explorer domination from the browser market is over, we still need it to view some Internet Explorer only sites that doesn't support the&nbsp;modern and crowd favorite browsers like <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/search/label/Google%20Chrome" target="_blank">Chrome</a>, <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/search/label/Mozilla%20Firefox" target="_blank">Firefox</a> or Opera. So even Chrome users may have to head over to Internet Explorer to open such Internet Explorer Friendly websites&nbsp;sometimes. To solve this issue, here we've found a very useful extension named IE Tab, which virtually opens up the Internet Explorer inside the Chrome window.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">IE Tab for Chrome is actually invented by the makers of IE Tab for Firefox, which actually emulates the Internet Explorer window in Google Chrome. It can be configured to launch IE based websites directly from the extension that you won't need to even think about heading over to actual Internet Explorer installation on your PC. Though you can't remove Internet Explorer because this extension uses the resources of Internet Explorer installed on your machine. So, don't forget to keep your Internet Explorer up-to-date so that we can be assured of full-proof security.</span><br /><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">What Are The Uses Of It?</span></h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">As mentioned earlier, The IE Tab uses the resources from the actual Internet Explorer installation that resides in your Windows. So if you are using the OS other than Windows, say MacOS or Linux, this extension will not work. If we ignore this limitation, it has many usages:</span><br /><ul><li><b><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Web Development</span></b><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;– View web pages in IE 7, IE 8, or IE 9 mode.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>IE-Only Websites</b> – Load IE-only websites within Google Chrome.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Outlook Web Access &amp; Sharepoint</b> – Use features that only work in IE.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>ActiveX Controls</b> – Run ActiveX Controls, which is an IE-only technology</span></li></ul><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">How To Use IE Tab</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Well, installation is very simple. It is same as any other chrome extension installation. Just head over to <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hehijbfgiekmjfkfjpbkbammjbdenadd" target="_blank">IE Tab Page of Chrome Web Store</a> and install the extension by clicking "Add to Chrome". It will download and install automatically. When the installation is finished, you'll see the logo containing Internet Explorer at the Extension Bar beside the Wrench Menu of <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/search/label/Google%20Chrome" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>. Click it to open the Internet Explorer inside Chrome.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OE2Sv0_lVB8/UCPqE_uT7NI/AAAAAAAABIg/wZ-lQPRg0VM/s1600/09-08-2012+10-12-02+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OE2Sv0_lVB8/UCPqE_uT7NI/AAAAAAAABIg/wZ-lQPRg0VM/s1600/09-08-2012+10-12-02+PM.png" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">It will open up the currently open tab in the IE Mode. In this screenshot, I had <a href="http://google.com/">google.com</a> already opened, so it opened <a href="http://google.com/">google.com</a> in IE mode. You can browse normally as you would from Internet Explorer. Just enter the URL in the newly created address bar and it will open as if it is opening in the Internet Explorer.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">IE Tab doesn’t integrate perfectly with Chrome – each IE tab frame has its own address bar. To bookmark a page, click the bookmark icon on the IE Tab toolbar. IE Tab will create a bookmark and save it to the “IE Tab” folder on your bookmarks toolbar. When clicked, the bookmark will load the current page in an IE Tab.</span><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">You can tell it’s using Internet Explorer because it isn’t rendering TechnoTravel.in properly. (To be fair, the drop-down menu works properly when IE Tab is set to IE 9 mode, but it uses IE 7 compatibility mode by default.</span><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Advanced Features</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The IE Tab is feature-rich in terms of emulating the Internet Explorer. Just click on the Settings button of the IE Tab Bar to go to the settings page that will let you configure your IE Tab. It is fill with lot of features. Here are the details.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">First of all there are some General Options that needs no&nbsp;explanations!</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8rGP01QuWrY/UCPqYOq8RgI/AAAAAAAABIo/dQFRpiFEJgA/s1600/09-08-2012+09-53-11+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8rGP01QuWrY/UCPqYOq8RgI/AAAAAAAABIo/dQFRpiFEJgA/s1600/09-08-2012+09-53-11+PM.png" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Then there is the Auto URL feature. As the name suggest, you can configure to render particular website or link directly from IE Tab, so that you won't need to care to reload that particular website in the IE Tab. It will get captured by the IE Tab automatically.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6IxUHvyc3cg/UCPqfla69KI/AAAAAAAABIw/0gVBSLm3mds/s1600/09-08-2012+09-53-37+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6IxUHvyc3cg/UCPqfla69KI/AAAAAAAABIw/0gVBSLm3mds/s1600/09-08-2012+09-53-37+PM.png" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">If there exist some URLs from the Auto URLs that you still want to load via chrome, then you can do that as well. Just add that particular URL in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Auto URL Exceptions to serve your cause.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-n2AEZrf-RAs/UCPqmZUDQ3I/AAAAAAAABI4/sUSDgDi-TFM/s1600/09-08-2012+09-53-56+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-n2AEZrf-RAs/UCPqmZUDQ3I/AAAAAAAABI4/sUSDgDi-TFM/s1600/09-08-2012+09-53-56+PM.png" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">There is another interesting feature called IE Compatibility Mode that will load the pages with the IE mode that you want to emulate from. It supports variety of IE modes. By default, IE mode 7 is&nbsp;chosen.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-U7nsRqaumCw/UCPqsKJbo0I/AAAAAAAABJA/_rshrXPW8YA/s1600/09-08-2012+09-54-10+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-U7nsRqaumCw/UCPqsKJbo0I/AAAAAAAABJA/_rshrXPW8YA/s1600/09-08-2012+09-54-10+PM.png" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Do you still wanna use the Internet Explorer instead of this extension?

	     <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1VPZWQEvEI8/UCOHFilduzI/AAAAAAAABHM/K50osSzpW5o/s1600/browsers.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1VPZWQEvEI8/UCOHFilduzI/AAAAAAAABHM/K50osSzpW5o/s1600/browsers.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">There exist tons of web browsers on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=browser&amp;c=apps" target="_blank">Google's Play Store</a> to download from for the better web browsing experience, but which one to choose from them?, remains the ultimate question. So here we're discussing about the top 5 web browsers that will make your browsing experience a lot easier and a lot better.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Though choosing the best from the tons might be a difficult task as the choices of browsers may differ with each personality depending upon their browsing habits and likings. Some like more&nbsp;minimalist approach whereas some want a feature-rich browser with lot of customizations to choose from. So, getting all this in a one .apk will be quite uphill task. So, we've decided to bring you not one or two but five, best in their class, web browsers to choose from according to your requirements.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: large;">Mozilla Firefox</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9LnMmwzVBGM/UCOHqAMyrWI/AAAAAAAABHs/cvsu3KWoN3o/s1600/firefox.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9LnMmwzVBGM/UCOHqAMyrWI/AAAAAAAABHs/cvsu3KWoN3o/s1600/firefox.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">It has been a long journey for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox" target="_blank">Firefox</a>, and it has improved a lot in its development time. Now the currently available version of Firefox is fast, it supports full sync, so if Firefox is your browser of choice in your PC, you can synchronize the open tabs right away to enjoy them on your Android.&nbsp;It's the first mobile browser to truly support Do Not Track, and the "Awesome Page" start screen that shows you all of your recently visited tabs helps you get right back to what you were doing if you had to put your phone down. It even supports add-ons and Personas, although there aren't too many of them yet. A few more options, and Firefox would be a good contender for our favorite, but it's clearly already one of yours, and for good reason.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: large;">Google Chrome</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NfbBh3cQt3c/UCOHoEnrgVI/AAAAAAAABHc/kFUZqMr_usw/s1600/chrome.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NfbBh3cQt3c/UCOHoEnrgVI/AAAAAAAABHc/kFUZqMr_usw/s1600/chrome.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Where Firefox goes, Chrome does follow. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome" target="_blank">Chrome</a> has finally left its beta state and it's now in more pleasing Stable state. As we see the "Stable" tag on Chrome state, we can anticipate it as the default browser on the next version of Android.&nbsp;If you are running ICS or Jelly Bean on your device, Chrome for Android is a must-download. It supports Incognito Mode browsing, bookmark syncing via Chrome Sync, and in its most recent updates, now supports search syncing, tab syncing, and more—anything that Chrome can sync on your desktop will be right there waiting for you on your Android device. Chrome for Android is also optimized for mobile, meaning it's blazing fast. The only drawback is that Google hasn't made it available for phones running Gingerbread or tablets stuck with Honeycomb.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: large;">Dolphin Browser HD</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lf4ZkKZyD5E/UCOHpM_x0RI/AAAAAAAABHk/luPbWC6mMMM/s1600/dolphin.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lf4ZkKZyD5E/UCOHpM_x0RI/AAAAAAAABHk/luPbWC6mMMM/s1600/dolphin.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">When the browser talk is going on, we can't miss the thirdparty - other than Mozilla or Google - browser, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.mgeek.TunnyBrowser" target="_blank">The Dolphin Browser HD</a>. It was launched a long ago, before Firefox and Chrome of course, and has been the popular among the Android Lovers. It offers the desktop chrome like user interface and plenty&nbsp;customizations in the form of Add-ons. You can load as many add-ons as you need to customize it as per your needs and requirements. Its built in tools like Dolphin Sonar - speech-to-text converter - and on-screen gesture to open bookmarks are its standout features and serves you well. The higher end Android phones like Galaxy s2, Galaxy Nexus and Galaxy S3 can exert its HD screen features to maximum with their beautiful HD screens, but even though you need not to have those phones to get amazed by it! Your own Android will equally amaze you with its features. That's why it's my personal favorite to use on my beautiful Galaxy Nexus!</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: large;">Opera Mobile/Mini</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ld0rJIcELXU/UCOHrK4phVI/AAAAAAAABH0/q7Hwj3PUzdQ/s1600/opera.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ld0rJIcELXU/UCOHrK4phVI/AAAAAAAABH0/q7Hwj3PUzdQ/s1600/opera.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Before Android came into spotlight, Opera Mini was the dominant force and the browser of choice for the dumb phones or say, not-so-smart phones. And even today that for that dumb phones, it is the best. But as we're talking about Android platform, I must mention that it lags behind the superior three - Dolphin Browser, Firefox and Chrome. Though, if you're a Opera fan on your PC, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.browser" target="_blank">Opera Mobile</a> is the perfect choice for you.&nbsp;Opera Mobile supports Opera Link, so you can sync your bookmarks, speed dial, and other user preferences with your desktop Opera install. Aside from that, Opera Mobile is fast, free, and goes out of its way to compress data in the background so you can browse your favorite sites without blowing past your wireless carrier's data caps. Opera even has its own mini-app store, full of third party add-ons that improve the browser or games that make it more fun to use. Have an older device? <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.mini.android" target="_blank">Opera Mini</a> might be a better choice—you get most of the features, but even more speed.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: large;">Stock Browser</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m3AGu-jRHfg/UCOHnM4nLlI/AAAAAAAABHU/9QTLdiAYbrU/s1600/boat.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m3AGu-jRHfg/UCOHnM4nLlI/AAAAAAAABHU/9QTLdiAYbrU/s1600/boat.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Well, lets not forget this one, the native browser of your Android. Though it might not be feature rich as compared to its counterparts, but it still does the fair job to get featured in this list. I don't have knowledge about the earlier stock browsers, but the stock browsers on Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean are blazingly fast and supports flash as well. Though you'll need to do a tweak to watch flash content on Jelly Bean, but it still serves well. It's my first choice to view flash content, and I don't know why, but it seems faster than any other browser on my Galaxy Nexus running 4.1.1 Jelly Bean! So you can compromise customizations for speed, Stock Browser is a great choice!</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">So, there we have it! Here are the 5 superior browsers for Android till now for you to choose from. If sync bothers you, go for Firefox or Chrome, if customizations and feature-rich browser is your first choice, go for Dolphin Browser HD. And if you can sacrifice anything for speed, Stock Browser and Opera Mobile are good choice. So, which is your favorite browser? Share your experince with your fav browser via comments below, and ya, it is not essential that you choose from the given list. If any other browser satisfies you more, you're the owner of your phone to use it, but don't forget to mention it into the comments form below!&nbsp;</span><br /><br /></div>

My personal favorite feature of any Nexus device is its superiority in getting the updates of the latest Android versions as soon as they are launched. And I also hate the bloatwares, so nexus devices comes in handy for that purpose too! (Though you can remove bloatware from the non-nexus devices with root&nbsp;privileges, but Vanilla Android is a class apart!)</span><br /><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The above statements were from the Nexus lover in me, so now we'll review the latest Nexus Device a unique way. What we've done here is that we've made a collection of the review videos from the trusted and pioneer in their own categories uploaders. Here we are sharing a collection of 8 YouTube videos from the&nbsp;renowned uploaders like Pocket Now, The Verge, PhoneArena, CNET, Mommy Loves Tech, Mobile Tech Review, The BGR Show and The Gadgate Show.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">After watching these videos, we hope that you will be able to make up your mind on whether to buy Google Nexus 7 or not!</span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Pocket Now</b></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The video from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/pocketnowvideo" target="_blank">Pocketnow</a> is brief but informative enough to have you an overview on the Google Nexus 7. The video deals with bot Hardware and Software, and comes up with the solid conclusions.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4jiu7_Auqyg?feature=player_embedded" width="540"></iframe> <br /><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>The Verge</b></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TheVerge">The Verge</a> takes a detailed look at the Nexus 7, with particular attention paid to new features present in Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean). In summing up Josh Topolsky calls the Nexus 7 “incredible,” not only at this $199 price point, but at any price point. He falls short of suggesting you buy this over an iPad, but only because developers need to start taking Android tablets seriously.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/EPLpHev1YnQ?feature=player_embedded" width="540"></iframe><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>CNET</b></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/CNETTV" target="_blank">CNET</a> only hives the brief overview, but it is still worth watching.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Y9odwaX2MGo?feature=player_embedded" width="540"></iframe><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>The Gadgate Show</b></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/thegadgetshow">The Gadget Show</a> offers up a short-but-sweet video review mostly filled with facts rather than opinion. According to the reviewer the Nexus 7 “is small, relatively cheap, and offers great performance.” They also suggest this tablet is “terrific value for money” despite the aforementioned lack of expandable memory or support for Flash. </span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div><br /><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Mommy Loves Tech</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MXqE0cbdock?feature=player_embedded" width="540"></iframe><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Mobile Tech Review</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/RyowcldPXCo?feature=player_embedded" width="540"></iframe><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>PhoneArena</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vp3Otpdrf1Q?feature=player_embedded" width="540"></iframe><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>The BGR Show</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jlNfUUgJ0IQ?feature=player_embedded" width="540"></iframe><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Conclusion</b></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444;"><br /></span></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">There we have it, eight video reviews of the Nexus 7 from a mixed range of sources. Some are long, some are short… some offer nothing but a brief overview of the device while some offer deep insights of both the hardware and software. All offer an opinion – hopefully an honest and unbiased one – that could and should help you decide whether to buy the Google nexus 7 or not.<br /><br />Have you already purchased the Nexus 7? If so, what do you think of it? If not, is it something you’re considering buying in the near future? What is holding you back from making the final decision to place your money down? Are you just a happy iPad owner who really doesn’t see the appeal of this young pretender? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below.</span><br /><div><br /></div></div>

Email, chatting, Office solutions, pictures - almost every thing is using cloud-based solutions these days. And even Antiviruses can't be excluded from this list. There are several online or cloud-based antivirus solutions available on the internet that can scan your computer from the internet browser. But, though online antiviruses are useful, they can't replace the Antivirus that resides in your computer hard drive.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Nevertheless, cloud-based antivirus applications offer a number of benefits and can be very useful for quickly scanning a PC for malware. But just don’t make them your only form of protection!</span><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>What Are Cloud Based Antiviruses?</b></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">If you want to access these cloud based antiviruses, all you need is a browser window and a working internet connection. There are plenty antiviruses available like - <a href="http://quickscan.bitdefender.com/" target="_blank">BitDefender Quick Scan</a> and <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/" target="_blank">ESET Online Sacnner</a> - these are cloud based antiviruses that will serve you well. Some antiviruses will download small .exe files to your computer to run the scan and some will use ActiveX controls to run the virus scanner in the browser window right away.</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4DVGvNFhs9g/UCFJ-CVTYBI/AAAAAAAABFE/EaJAUn5lcP4/s1600/07-08-2012+10-17-30+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="256" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4DVGvNFhs9g/UCFJ-CVTYBI/AAAAAAAABFE/EaJAUn5lcP4/s320/07-08-2012+10-17-30+PM.png" width="320" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">In the case of ESET Online Scanner - it will prompt you to download the .exe file to carry out the quick scan on your PC.&nbsp;Bitdefender QuickScan installs a browser extension.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">After you launch the cloud-based antivirus, it will scan your system for potential threats and alert you to them. Depending on the cloud-based antivirus, it may not remove viruses it finds, or it may only perform a quick scan for viruses and other malware, not an in-depth one.</span><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Lack Of Real-Time Scanning</b></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The biggest drawback of the online antivirus is its&nbsp;inability to monitor your PC in real-time. Though some people might feel that the online security is the one and only threat nowadays and preventing viruses penetrating in their PC through Internet will assure the full security to their computer, then I'm afraid you're wrong here. There are plenty different threats - Viruses, Trojans or Spywares - that have ability to penetrate through the USB drives and damage your computer big time. So it's always advisable to use a well-known native Antivirus on your PC that supports Real-time scanning to help you detect and prevent from such threats.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">If you are thinking cloud antiviruses as the one and only protection method to&nbsp;prevent&nbsp;your computer from threats, then I advise you to think twice before making such decision only due to the reason explain above - Lack of Real-Time Scanning.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Some Other Limitations of Cloud Antiviruses</b></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Some online antiviruses don’t even perform the functions you might expect from an antivirus. For example, ESET Online Scanner can scan your entire system for malware and quarantine it. However, Bitdefender QuickScan just scans your system’s startup files and memory for viruses – it doesn’t look for dormant viruses hiding elsewhere on your system. If Bitdefender QuickScan finds a virus, it won’t remove it for you – it will recommend you download a full Bitdefender product to remove the virus.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Though There are Some Benefits Too!</b></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Even though Online Virus Scanning Tools might not fancy their chance to be your primary antivirus, there lies some benefits of them that are worth mentioning here.</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sbeLK3iJpY4/UCFKQXHf9dI/AAAAAAAABFM/9i3Qg36wftQ/s1600/07-08-2012+10-23-28+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="197" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sbeLK3iJpY4/UCFKQXHf9dI/AAAAAAAABFM/9i3Qg36wftQ/s320/07-08-2012+10-23-28+PM.png" width="320" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><ul><li><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Quick Scanning</b> : Even though it's named as "Quick Scan", the Quick Scan from our native antivirus can take ages if you've lot of stuff loaded on your computer.
