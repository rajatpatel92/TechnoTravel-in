	     <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">As a frequent flasher or ROMs, Mods and Kernels, I know the pain of losing out the USB cable only a couple minutes ago before Flashing "commence"!!&nbsp;Then there’s the trial and error process that comes with testing new themes, mods, and ROMs. However, this can all be avoided simply with&nbsp;RemoteFlash. The remote flashing app developed by XDA-Developers member <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2307677" target="_blank">Prl91</a>.<br /><br />RemoteFlash allows you to flash ROMS, Mods, and Updates directly from your computer, over WiFi. As of the moment it only allows one file to be flashed at a time. The limit will be raised as the development goes on, but for the time being, RemoteFlash just about serves our purpose.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>Though one "downside" you might consider here is that this app uses "OpenRecoveryScript". So that if you have TWRP [TeamWin Recovery Project], then you are good to go, but the users with CWM [ClockWorkMod] Recovery installed might not have the smooth ride. Though&nbsp;CWM may be usable depending on the build installed.</div><div><br />To use RemoteFlash simply download two files at the end of this post. One is a standalone Java application that you run on your computer. The other file is the RemoteFlash apk. After downloading and installing both programs, run the RemoteFlash apk. You will only need to run the app once. After opening RemoteFlash the first time just reboot your device.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FDAheKADpmQ/UbQ4fAYMWZI/AAAAAAAAB1w/-E6qFGpUehU/s1600/Screenshot_2013-06-09-13-02-40.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FDAheKADpmQ/UbQ4fAYMWZI/AAAAAAAAB1w/-E6qFGpUehU/s400/Screenshot_2013-06-09-13-02-40.png" width="225" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>As soon as your device boots back up, RemoteFlash service will be running in background.

	     <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cdkpuL-Vjlo/UJ0y65yLHII/AAAAAAAABX4/9StKfDXJySk/s1600/Screenshot_2012-11-09-22-01-08.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cdkpuL-Vjlo/UJ0y65yLHII/AAAAAAAABX4/9StKfDXJySk/s320/Screenshot_2012-11-09-22-01-08.png" width="180" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Most of Android fans generally use Task Manager to kill the Apps that are consuming RAM which results in the slow performance and poor battery life.&nbsp;By closing apps running in the background,&nbsp;you'll&nbsp;get improved performance and battery life – that’s the idea, anyway. But in reality, task killers can reduce your phone's performance and battery life. Here we're explaining the reason.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Basically, the Task Killers kills the particular app that is residing in the memory, thus freeing up your phone's memory. But in fact, Android's own memory management is so powerful that you don't need to use any Task Killer. In fact, doing so disturbs the automatic process which is rather bad thing.</span><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></h3><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></h3><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Process Management In Android Is Different From Windows</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Most of Android users are very much familiar and used to Windows.&nbsp;On Windows, many programs running at one time – whether they’re windows on your desktop or applications in your system tray – can decrease your computer’s performance. Closing applications when&nbsp;you're&nbsp;not using them can help speed up your Windows computer.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uKq_rLL9O9o/UJ0zWYgvnKI/AAAAAAAABYA/WZKGiKbkVxw/s1600/Screenshot_2012-11-09-22-04-33.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uKq_rLL9O9o/UJ0zWYgvnKI/AAAAAAAABYA/WZKGiKbkVxw/s640/Screenshot_2012-11-09-22-04-33.png" width="640" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">However, Android is&nbsp;altogether&nbsp;a different scenario than Windows. In Windows, there is an obvious way to "close" an application, whereas, this is not the case with Android. You won't find any convincing way to actually "close" an app in Android. Some user might see this as a problem. But in fact, it's in design and not a problem by any means.&nbsp;When you leave an Android app, going back to your home screen or switching to another app, the app stays “running” in the background. In most cases, the app will be paused in the background, taking up no CPU or network resources. Some apps will continue using CPU and network resources in the background, of course – for example, music players, file-downloading programs, or apps that sync in the background.<br /><br />When you go back to an app you were recently using, Android “unpauses” that app and you resume where you left off. This is fast because the app is still stored in your RAM and ready to be used again.</span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Task Killers Are Bad</span></h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YpqN2yeXblE/UJ00AGAB3lI/AAAAAAAABYI/InVyW6Gd0Tc/s1600/Screenshot_2012-11-09-22-01-52.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YpqN2yeXblE/UJ00AGAB3lI/AAAAAAAABYI/InVyW6Gd0Tc/s400/Screenshot_2012-11-09-22-01-52.png" width="225" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Most task killers notice that Android uses a lot of memory - in fact, Android stores running or recently used apps into memory which fills up the RAM. But this, by no means, a bad practice. Apps that are stored in the RAM can be quickly switched back to when needed rather than retrieving it from the storage, which is a very slow process compared to&nbsp;retrieval time from RAM.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">And moreover, the freed up RAM is of no use and it doesn't saves the battery either. We all live in a myth that more free the RAM is, the less power it consumes. But this doesn't holds the truth. The totally full RAM consumes the same amount of power the half-full RAM consumes. So killing tasks or apps will save the battery power holds no truth. And in case of the RAM is full and more memory is needed to run the app than available, Android is smart enough to kill the app automatically which is not used for a while and free up the RAM for the new app. No task killers are&nbsp;required&nbsp;for this purpose.</span></div><div><br /></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Task killers think they know better than Android. They run in the background, automatically quitting apps and removing them from Android’s memory. They may also allow you to force-quit apps on your own, but you&nbsp;shouldn't&nbsp;have to do this.<br /><br />Task killers&nbsp;aren't&nbsp;just useless – they can reduce performance as well. If a task killer removes an app from your RAM and you open that app again, the app will be slower to load as Android is forced to load it from your device’s storage. This will also use more battery power than if you just left the app in your RAM in the first place. Some apps will automatically restart after the task killer quits them, using more CPU and battery resources. Thus reducing the battery life.</span><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Though Task Killers Can Help Sometime</span></h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7DAGQ716Srk/UJ00WUzw7MI/AAAAAAAABYQ/jzEhsAuUsaM/s1600/Screenshot_2012-11-09-22-02-27.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7DAGQ716Srk/UJ00WUzw7MI/AAAAAAAABYQ/jzEhsAuUsaM/s640/Screenshot_2012-11-09-22-02-27.png" width="360" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">At this point of time while you are reading this article, some users won't agree with the fact that are presented to them before. Because they might have noticed a performance boost and increased battery life after using Task Killer.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">This might hold truth by the way! But only in case you have a badly compiled app installed on your phone.&nbsp;If you have a bad app that’s using CPU and other resources in the background, a task killer that closes the misbehaving app can improve your battery life and make your phone faster.</span></div><div><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">However, using a task killer to deal with a misbehaving app is like using a shotgun to kill a fly – you may fix your problem, but&nbsp;you're&nbsp;inflicting a lot of other damage in the process.<br /><br />Instead of using a task killer in this situation, you should identify the bad app and uninstall it, replacing it with an app that works properly. To pin down the app that’s misbehaving, you can try the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zomut.watchdoglite">Watchdog Task Manager</a> app – it will show you which apps are actually using CPU in the background, not which apps are harmlessly being stored in memory.</span><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Conclusion</span></h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Task killers can also cause other problems by killing applications that you want running in the background — for example, if you use an alarm clock app, you may find that your task killer forced the alarm clock app to quit, preventing the alarm from going off.<br /><br />CyanogenMod, the popular community-developed Android Custom ROM,&nbsp;won't&nbsp;even accept bug reports from users using task killers, saying that they cause more problems than they solve.<br /><br />In summary, you&nbsp;shouldn't&nbsp;use a task killer – if you have a misbehaving app wasting resources in the background, you should identify it and uninstall it. But&nbsp;don't&nbsp;just remove apps from your phone or tablet’s RAM – that&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;help speed anything up.</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div></div>

	  <title>Still No Jelly Bean For Your Android? Get Its Best Features with These Apps</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">It has not been all to long ago, <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/searcl/label/Google">Google</a> released Android 4.1.1 named Jelly Bean. If you want to check out all the main improvements in detail check out <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/2012/06/google-announces-android-41-jelly-bean.html">this article</a>. It's been the fastest and the most feature-rich Android OS till date. Though it's great to see these new technology already released, the update schedule to actually implement it on the broader level is rather unacceptable. Though it is now roughly around 3 months from the initial announcement of Jelly Bean at Google I/O, there are hardly any devices other than Nexus devices (Which receive updates directly from Google, of course!), that are running on Jelly Bean 4.1.1. Even there is a large number of Mid-range Android devices that are still waiting to receive Ice-Creme Sandwich 4.0.,&nbsp;and even those who do get the update might not see it until a year after Google released it, if not longer.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">So, if you're tired of waiting for the updates, and want to have a feel of Jelly Bean, you certainly can tweak your Gingerbread or ICS running Android's UI to get the visual feel of Jelly Bean. Though, to get the performance boost like Jelly Bean, you will have to wait longer, of course.&nbsp;So instead of waiting for either the update or a new phone, you can take advantage of some of the features it provides right on your current version by way of apps.</span><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Locker &amp; Launcher</span></h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zvUa7wMD_wU/UF6b7rtxj3I/AAAAAAAABTU/xLkumi3L-RY/s1600/locker.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zvUa7wMD_wU/UF6b7rtxj3I/AAAAAAAABTU/xLkumi3L-RY/s1600/locker.jpg" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The Launcher is not updated much in Jelly Bean from Ice Creme Sandwich. So, any Ice Creme Sandwich launcher will perfectly serve our purpose. In such case, you can opt for having <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobint.hololauncher">Holo Launcher</a> which is same as stock ICS/Jelly Bean Launcher.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MY0rBAcFMXU/UF6cLwCIMsI/AAAAAAAABTk/F_uPhQxgVmU/s1600/JB+live.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MY0rBAcFMXU/UF6cLwCIMsI/AAAAAAAABTk/F_uPhQxgVmU/s1600/JB+live.jpg" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Whereas, the same story gets repeated in the locker department as well. The locker is also kept unchanged. There is just a slight change in animation from ICS, nothing else. So, to have the locker same as Jelly Bean, you can opt for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobint.locker">Holo Locker</a>. It's 99% same as Stock Jelly Bean Locker.</span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Wallpapers</span></h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U3WPTRhpTcY/UF6cZ146FhI/AAAAAAAABTs/v9TXE2c6EUE/s1600/Screenshot_2012-09-23-10-15-56.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U3WPTRhpTcY/UF6cZ146FhI/AAAAAAAABTs/v9TXE2c6EUE/s640/Screenshot_2012-09-23-10-15-56.png" width="360" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">As said earlier, the Jelly Bean is more focused towards system performance rather than UI changes. So, it&nbsp;naively doesn't offer much of new Wallpapers from ICS, but still there are some worth considering.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">You can install Live wallpapers via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androidwasabi.livewallpaper.jellybean">this app</a> and Static Wallpapers via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kov.gallery.jellybean">this app</a>.&nbsp;</span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Status Bar</span></h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-juhQUfKFGUI/UF6cFoYeV5I/AAAAAAAABTc/i6pViS5s7Mo/s1600/Status+Bar.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-juhQUfKFGUI/UF6cFoYeV5I/AAAAAAAABTc/i6pViS5s7Mo/s1600/Status+Bar.jpg" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">To have a complete feel of Jelly Bean, you might want to change the status bar to that of Jelly Bean. There’s also <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.calsto.statusbar.jb">an app</a> which takes care of that for you, and includes a couple other customizations which make the app quite worthwhile.</span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Keyboard</span></h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mKWNunwoNNk/UF6c4h3_IYI/AAAAAAAABT0/B5dK9sSWsyA/s1600/Screenshot_2012-09-23-10-17-59.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mKWNunwoNNk/UF6c4h3_IYI/AAAAAAAABT0/B5dK9sSWsyA/s640/Screenshot_2012-09-23-10-17-59.png" width="360" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The major improvement for Android in Jelly Bean is it's keyboard.

The only downside is that only ICS users can install it, so any Android 2.x user won't be able to use it. :(</span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Options For Rooted Devices</span></h3><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8TO9_KX52xk/UF6dW7ptdII/AAAAAAAABT8/WPBTVWh6jnU/s1600/CyanogenMod1.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8TO9_KX52xk/UF6dW7ptdII/AAAAAAAABT8/WPBTVWh6jnU/s320/CyanogenMod1.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Image Courtesy : <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/android/cyanogenmod-team-considers-deploying-proprietary-app-store-for-root-apps/" target="_blank">xda-Developers</a></td></tr></tbody></table><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">If you own a rooted device, then in my opinion, go for any custom ROM like Cyanogenmod (CM) to get the feel of the new OS rather than waiting for the official updates, which never come as promised if you own a device other than Nexus. Only Nexus devices gets updates faster than ever. So, waiting for the official update for a rooted device is not worth it. If you're rooted, you must have to be on ICS or Jelly Bean&nbsp;until&nbsp;now in my opinion. And if you're still stuck on Gingerbread, you might consider installing any Custom ROM that has support for your device. If you don't know whether your device is supported or not, just leave a comment for me, I'll surely help you out.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><br /></div></div>

	     <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-McsYNYawaME/UDHWAUhyBqI/AAAAAAAABRM/LYhX9HRxYaU/s1600/cloud_storage_2_web_0.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-McsYNYawaME/UDHWAUhyBqI/AAAAAAAABRM/LYhX9HRxYaU/s1600/cloud_storage_2_web_0.png" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Well, backups are essential and we've been told many times how important they are, although we may not pay attention to it until it's too late and we lose all our data! Though you can always backup your important data on your external physical hard drive,&nbsp;but free online backup services provide useful redundancy that could save your data big time!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">If you are a regular TechnoTravel.in reader, you may get this now that we're fan of <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/2012/08/pros-and-cons-of-cloud-basedonline-antivirus.html">cloud computing</a> and we will be writing numerous articles in coming future to let the world understand it's pros and cons. So, as a part of that effort, here we're mentioning out some useful and FREE websites, 15 to be precise, that offer free cloud storage space to let you backup, share or synchronize your data. Each of these services offers a free plan, most also having options for paid subscriptions that offer more storage space, and possibly additional features. Most of these services offer useful backup features such as automatic backups, scheduling, versioning, and restore features. Some services offer other useful features, such as the ability to access your backed up files anywhere using a browser or mobile apps and the ability to stream your media files to your mobile device.</span><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Microsoft SkyDrive</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/skydrive/home" target="_blank">Microsoft SkyDrive</a> offers 7GB of free data for the new subscribers. It used to offer 25GB in its initial stages, but now it's reduced down to 7GB. Though 7GB is also a good cloud storage space. The old subscribers, like me, are allowed to keep their 25GBs for free.</span></div><div><br /></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Store your files on SkyDrive and you can access them from your Android phone, iPhone, iPad, Windows phone in addition to your PC or Mac.&nbsp;Use SkyDrive to share large files and photos with your friends and family. They only need a web browser to access the files and photos.</span><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Though there are some drawbacks of SkyDrive that are worth mentioning here. Firstly, it&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;offer any considerable security to the files you upload, so if you are about to upload your sensitive data on SkyDrive, stop here. The other drawback is that it offers only one folder named SkyDrive, thus if you have data sorted out in many folders, you might find it difficult to upload it on SkyDrive.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">With 7 GB of free storage, SkyDrive is a good place to store your photos and other non-sensitive documents. Use other free backup services for your sensitive and private files. We mention which ones provide encryption for files uploaded to and retrieved from their service.</span><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9Eick34xGX4/UDHSVClEmVI/AAAAAAAABPU/Pr2qfk2ov9s/s1600/20-08-2012+10-05-48+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9Eick34xGX4/UDHSVClEmVI/AAAAAAAABPU/Pr2qfk2ov9s/s1600/20-08-2012+10-05-48+AM.png" /></a></div><div><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Box</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.box.com/" target="_blank">Box</a>&nbsp;is a good backup solution for the small but important files, as it offers 5GB of storage space with the file size limit of 100MB.&nbsp;The free account also allows you to create file sharing links and provides secure transfer and storage of your data. You can access your data anywhere, anytime, on any device, such as a desktop computer, a laptop, an iPhone, an iPad, or an Android device.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Organize your files online using folders just like you would on your desktop PC. Edit your documents online and save them directly back into your Box account using your native desktop applications.&nbsp;Use Box to share large files easily, rather than trying to email big files, such as videos or presentations.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">If you need more than 5 GB of storage space, you can <a href="https://www.box.com/pricing/">upgrade your account</a> to 25 GB of space for $9.99 per month, or 50 GB of space for $19.99 per month.

It allows you to&nbsp;backup your data to your friends, families, and colleague’s computers for free. All backed up files are encrypted locally before they are sent to your buddies’ machines and only you have the encryption keys. So, your buddies can’t read your files.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">You don’t have to worry about your backups staying on your buddies’ computers. You can setup BuddyBackup to backup multiple copies of your files, so you’re sure you have backups. Two copies of your data are spread among your buddies by default. BuddyBackup also regularly checks that your buddies still have your backups. If there is a problem on a buddy’s computer, BuddyBackup automatically backs up your files to a different buddy instead. So, if one of your buddies uninstalls BuddyBackup or their computer fails, your data is still safe</span><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">You can also backup your data offline to your own external hard drives.<br /><br />If your computer crashes and you have to restore your data to a new computer, you can easily do so by running BuddyBackup on your new computer. You can also recover your files from a friend’s computer, if you haven’t replaced your computer yet, using the Guest Mode. In Guest Mode, you can’t add to backups; you can only restore files from existing backups.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EJGH6RQiPcM/UDHTf24_H6I/AAAAAAAABP8/_XQN8FSazLY/s1600/20-08-2012+11-11-28+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EJGH6RQiPcM/UDHTf24_H6I/AAAAAAAABP8/_XQN8FSazLY/s1600/20-08-2012+11-11-28+AM.png" /></a></div><h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">DropBox</span></h3><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/pricing">Dropbox</a> offers 2 GB of storage for free, and the ability to sync files and folders between your Windows, Mac, or Linux computer and the cloud.

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/DWsm7ADk8Q4?feature=player_embedded" width="550"></iframe>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Fast Burst Camera App for Android allows your device to capture rapid-fire shots in a quick succession - similar to the Burst Camera Mode of the higher end phones like Galaxy S3 or HTC One X - with the support to capture as fast as 30 frames per second if your Android allows it! So, just capture multiple shots of your playing kid or flying bird with this Fast Burst Camera App and later choose the best one among them to have a perfect capture!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jRcvt1t2s6o/UCpGsWH8h4I/AAAAAAAABOo/hVPYgvNM5Ps/s1600/FBC+play.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="125" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jRcvt1t2s6o/UCpGsWH8h4I/AAAAAAAABOo/hVPYgvNM5Ps/s200/FBC+play.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The app actually comes in two versions - Free and Paid ($4). The free version is ad-supported and comes with the basic features, whereas the paid version is of course ad-free version with some additional features like auto-focus, zoom, and disabling the shutter (Shutter sound can be annoying at time, I tell you!). Though you'll need to shell out $4 to get the full&nbsp;featured app, but it's worth buying. So, just test the free version and if it satisfies you, then you can opt for buying it to help the developer.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1Ku1H88ryHU/UCpGWFetzwI/AAAAAAAABOg/O8EfCrQd4j4/s1600/FBC+app.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1Ku1H88ryHU/UCpGWFetzwI/AAAAAAAABOg/O8EfCrQd4j4/s200/FBC+app.jpg" width="119" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The working of the Fast Burst Camera app is pretty simple. It stores the quickly captured pics in the memory for the later processing and once you're done capturing in the burst mode, it quickly transfers to the SD card. Thus the maximum number of pics you can take are unlimited&nbsp;theoretically but practically it depends on how much memory your Android allots to the app. Though there is no limit on the number of pics to be captured at once, obviously high number of pics will require more memory and will acquire more time to get saved in your gallery, which can be quite cumbersome at times!</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The app also provides some settings to get configured by the user like choosing the resolution of the photos and control over memory allocation to this app. Though one thing should be noticed here is, higher the resolution of photos, more time it takes to get saved in your SD card. When we tested this app on our 1.2GHz dual-core Galaxy Nexus, it did a fantastic job to become my favorite camera app, and above all, it's free folks!</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">So, if your Android is not yet equipped with a third party camera app that does this, this app is&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;worth trying!</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spritefish.fastburstcameralite">Download Fast Burst Camera (free)</a>&nbsp;[Google Play Link]</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spritefish.fastburstcamera&amp;feature=more_from_developer#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEwMiwiY29tLnNwcml0ZWZpc2guZmFzdGJ1cnN0Y2FtZXJhIl0">Download Fast Burst Camera (Paid $4)</a> [Google Play Link]</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Originally From : <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1709506">xda-developers</a></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div></div>

	  <title>Google Translate Gets Updated For Android, Now Supports Translating Photos</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate">Google Translate</a> App is now updated on Android as it supports translating photos as well. Which means, in real world, if you see any poster written in any other language which is unknown to you, just point your Android's camera towards it, take a snap and Google Translate will translate the contents of that pic. Though you'll need to highlight the text you want to translate.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">For now, only <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/search/label/Android">Android</a> users can take advantage of this feature.&nbsp;It works with most of the languages that are supported by Google Translate.  The app doesn’t have the ability to automatically detect what language is captured in an image, so the user needs to know the language they’re looking at, but the feature otherwise works on any high-contrast text. Stylized or low-contrast text might trip it up.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FaF3q8VqeXw/UCU6E1acUKI/AAAAAAAABKw/DCT2m6hNOlo/s1600/translate.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FaF3q8VqeXw/UCU6E1acUKI/AAAAAAAABKw/DCT2m6hNOlo/s1600/translate.jpg" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Users will also need to make sure that the text they want to translate must fit in the single photograph. So, it will not be useful for the big posters or the big&nbsp;length&nbsp;text. Thus, as of now, it'll only work on the smaller images where the text is clear and all in one image. Though, as a popular Google product, it will only get better!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Even though there exists some limitations, it is still a very major leap forward from Google.&nbsp;Typing in a phrase from a foreign language can take some time and is subject to typos. Taking a photograph is quicker and more accurate.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">This app will work on the Android versions 2.3(Gingerbread) and above. So why wait, just download or update your Google Translate on your Android.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate">Download or Update Google Translate</a>&nbsp;from <a href="https://play.google.com/store">Google Play</a></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div>

And as we go through our initial checking period, we weren't disappointed. In fact, we're pleased to see such a beautiful web app.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">You can sign into Pulse either via Facebook or via their own account. As you sign in for first time, it'll ask you for your interests. There are plenty of options to choose from, just click your interests and done! You are good to go!</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tSmXKZOdnns/UCSdTvLMDuI/AAAAAAAABJs/uHplkjstvrc/s1600/10-08-2012+10-15-25+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tSmXKZOdnns/UCSdTvLMDuI/AAAAAAAABJs/uHplkjstvrc/s1600/10-08-2012+10-15-25+AM.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Pulse's user interface is very refreshing as it reminds me of the interface of Windows 8's Metro UI. It seems similar to Metro UI (Or whatever Microsoft will choose it's name!) with the different style of tiles full of high quality images. And with the dark background, same as Android App, it feels like a real eye-candy. I personally liked the dark background on their <a href="http://www.technotravel.in/search/label/Android">Android</a> App, and I liked it here, too. If you don't like the different-sized tiles, then you can always arrange them in a same order from the top-right menu.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TpKosy9Mz1Q/UCSdlLR87gI/AAAAAAAABJ0/vnLz9a0U4qA/s1600/10-08-2012+10-19-58+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TpKosy9Mz1Q/UCSdlLR87gI/AAAAAAAABJ0/vnLz9a0U4qA/s1600/10-08-2012+10-19-58+AM.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">To read the particular story, you need to click the image thumbnail and the story will pop-up. This is very&nbsp;minimalist UI and highly focused on the content to provide you best reading experience.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pXneslFeRQQ/UCSeIiP4KkI/AAAAAAAABKE/GSRGhyNCxbc/s1600/10-08-2012+10-24-24+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pXneslFeRQQ/UCSeIiP4KkI/AAAAAAAABKE/GSRGhyNCxbc/s1600/10-08-2012+10-24-24+AM.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The default fonts are very smooth and feels very easy on the eye, though if you don't like it, there are some options in the left bar to customize it as per your need. You can change toggle the background between dark and light, and you can change the fonts as well.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F25DFDwSeSU/UCSdvVaV2AI/AAAAAAAABJ8/nzFgDHdNs60/s1600/10-08-2012+10-25-17+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F25DFDwSeSU/UCSdvVaV2AI/AAAAAAAABJ8/nzFgDHdNs60/s1600/10-08-2012+10-25-17+AM.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The left bar on the reader pop-up also contains the quick share buttons to share the story to your friends and followers. You can always add content in your Pulse. Just click "Add Content" to bring the pop-up from the right to add the content easily. Though one drawback here is that you can't add the custom feeds on your own. Though there are plenty of resources to choose from, but we feel these feature missing from Pulse that the developers should focus upon.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0nDmZEY8vmY/UCSeRiyrHMI/AAAAAAAABKM/NLajuW7iOH0/s1600/10-08-2012+10-48-14+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0nDmZEY8vmY/UCSeRiyrHMI/AAAAAAAABKM/NLajuW7iOH0/s1600/10-08-2012+10-48-14+AM.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Other than this, we didn't find any bug, and performance vise it feels very smooth on Google Chrome. One thing you might notice that besides being such an image-heavy site, it loads up surprisingly fast that adds to it usefulness.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">From my personal point-of-view, I'll be using this app right away as I love its interface and speed. What do you feel about this Web App? Feel free to share your thoughts via comment form below and express yourself!</span><br /><br /></div>

So here we're discussing about the top 5 web browsers that will make your browsing experience a lot easier and a lot better.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Though choosing the best from the tons might be a difficult task as the choices of browsers may differ with each personality depending upon their browsing habits and likings. Some like more&nbsp;minimalist approach whereas some want a feature-rich browser with lot of customizations to choose from. So, getting all this in a one .apk will be quite uphill task. So, we've decided to bring you not one or two but five, best in their class, web browsers to choose from according to your requirements.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: large;">Mozilla Firefox</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9LnMmwzVBGM/UCOHqAMyrWI/AAAAAAAABHs/cvsu3KWoN3o/s1600/firefox.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9LnMmwzVBGM/UCOHqAMyrWI/AAAAAAAABHs/cvsu3KWoN3o/s1600/firefox.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">It has been a long journey for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox" target="_blank">Firefox</a>, and it has improved a lot in its development time. Now the currently available version of Firefox is fast, it supports full sync, so if Firefox is your browser of choice in your PC, you can synchronize the open tabs right away to enjoy them on your Android.&nbsp;It's the first mobile browser to truly support Do Not Track, and the "Awesome Page" start screen that shows you all of your recently visited tabs helps you get right back to what you were doing if you had to put your phone down. It even supports add-ons and Personas, although there aren't too many of them yet. A few more options, and Firefox would be a good contender for our favorite, but it's clearly already one of yours, and for good reason.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: large;">Google Chrome</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NfbBh3cQt3c/UCOHoEnrgVI/AAAAAAAABHc/kFUZqMr_usw/s1600/chrome.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NfbBh3cQt3c/UCOHoEnrgVI/AAAAAAAABHc/kFUZqMr_usw/s1600/chrome.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Where Firefox goes, Chrome does follow. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome" target="_blank">Chrome</a> has finally left its beta state and it's now in more pleasing Stable state. As we see the "Stable" tag on Chrome state, we can anticipate it as the default browser on the next version of Android.&nbsp;If you are running ICS or Jelly Bean on your device, Chrome for Android is a must-download. It supports Incognito Mode browsing, bookmark syncing via Chrome Sync, and in its most recent updates, now supports search syncing, tab syncing, and more—anything that Chrome can sync on your desktop will be right there waiting for you on your Android device. Chrome for Android is also optimized for mobile, meaning it's blazing fast. The only drawback is that Google hasn't made it available for phones running Gingerbread or tablets stuck with Honeycomb.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: large;">Dolphin Browser HD</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lf4ZkKZyD5E/UCOHpM_x0RI/AAAAAAAABHk/luPbWC6mMMM/s1600/dolphin.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lf4ZkKZyD5E/UCOHpM_x0RI/AAAAAAAABHk/luPbWC6mMMM/s1600/dolphin.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">When the browser talk is going on, we can't miss the thirdparty - other than Mozilla or Google - browser, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.mgeek.TunnyBrowser" target="_blank">The Dolphin Browser HD</a>. It was launched a long ago, before Firefox and Chrome of course, and has been the popular among the Android Lovers. It offers the desktop chrome like user interface and plenty&nbsp;customizations in the form of Add-ons. You can load as many add-ons as you need to customize it as per your needs and requirements. Its built in tools like Dolphin Sonar - speech-to-text converter - and on-screen gesture to open bookmarks are its standout features and serves you well. The higher end Android phones like Galaxy s2, Galaxy Nexus and Galaxy S3 can exert its HD screen features to maximum with their beautiful HD screens, but even though you need not to have those phones to get amazed by it! Your own Android will equally amaze you with its features. That's why it's my personal favorite to use on my beautiful Galaxy Nexus!</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: large;">Opera Mobile/Mini</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ld0rJIcELXU/UCOHrK4phVI/AAAAAAAABH0/q7Hwj3PUzdQ/s1600/opera.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ld0rJIcELXU/UCOHrK4phVI/AAAAAAAABH0/q7Hwj3PUzdQ/s1600/opera.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Before Android came into spotlight, Opera Mini was the dominant force and the browser of choice for the dumb phones or say, not-so-smart phones. And even today that for that dumb phones, it is the best. But as we're talking about Android platform, I must mention that it lags behind the superior three - Dolphin Browser, Firefox and Chrome. Though, if you're a Opera fan on your PC, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.browser" target="_blank">Opera Mobile</a> is the perfect choice for you.&nbsp;Opera Mobile supports Opera Link, so you can sync your bookmarks, speed dial, and other user preferences with your desktop Opera install. Aside from that, Opera Mobile is fast, free, and goes out of its way to compress data in the background so you can browse your favorite sites without blowing past your wireless carrier's data caps. Opera even has its own mini-app store, full of third party add-ons that improve the browser or games that make it more fun to use. Have an older device? <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.mini.android" target="_blank">Opera Mini</a> might be a better choice—you get most of the features, but even more speed.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: large;">Stock Browser</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m3AGu-jRHfg/UCOHnM4nLlI/AAAAAAAABHU/9QTLdiAYbrU/s1600/boat.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m3AGu-jRHfg/UCOHnM4nLlI/AAAAAAAABHU/9QTLdiAYbrU/s1600/boat.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Well, lets not forget this one, the native browser of your Android. Though it might not be feature rich as compared to its counterparts, but it still does the fair job to get featured in this list. I don't have knowledge about the earlier stock browsers, but the stock browsers on Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean are blazingly fast and supports flash as well. Though you'll need to do a tweak to watch flash content on Jelly Bean, but it still serves well. It's my first choice to view flash content, and I don't know why, but it seems faster than any other browser on my Galaxy Nexus running 4.1.1 Jelly Bean! So you can compromise customizations for speed, Stock Browser is a great choice!</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">So, there we have it! Here are the 5 superior browsers for Android till now for you to choose from. If sync bothers you, go for Firefox or Chrome, if customizations and feature-rich browser is your first choice, go for Dolphin Browser HD. And if you can sacrifice anything for speed, Stock Browser and Opera Mobile are good choice. So, which is your favorite browser? Share your experince with your fav browser via comments below, and ya, it is not essential that you choose from the given list. If any other browser satisfies you more, you're the owner of your phone to use it, but don't forget to mention it into the comments form below!&nbsp;</span><br /><br /></div>

	     <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p7JGxwSkPWk/UCK5b6J81FI/AAAAAAAABGk/BlIi2VDgVic/s1600/tablet-n7-features-ushome-family.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p7JGxwSkPWk/UCK5b6J81FI/AAAAAAAABGk/BlIi2VDgVic/s1600/tablet-n7-features-ushome-family.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">From my point of view, as a Nexus deice lover and owner, I would definitely recommend to buy Google Nexus 7, the latest Nexus series Tablet from Google. My personal favorite feature of any Nexus device is its superiority in getting the updates of the latest Android versions as soon as they are launched. And I also hate the bloatwares, so nexus devices comes in handy for that purpose too! (Though you can remove bloatware from the non-nexus devices with root&nbsp;privileges, but Vanilla Android is a class apart!)</span><br /><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The above statements were from the Nexus lover in me, so now we'll review the latest Nexus Device a unique way. What we've done here is that we've made a collection of the review videos from the trusted and pioneer in their own categories uploaders. Here we are sharing a collection of 8 YouTube videos from the&nbsp;renowned uploaders like Pocket Now, The Verge, PhoneArena, CNET, Mommy Loves Tech, Mobile Tech Review, The BGR Show and The Gadgate Show.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">After watching these videos, we hope that you will be able to make up your mind on whether to buy Google Nexus 7 or not!</span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Pocket Now</b></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The video from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/pocketnowvideo" target="_blank">Pocketnow</a> is brief but informative enough to have you an overview on the Google Nexus 7. The video deals with bot Hardware and Software, and comes up with the solid conclusions.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4jiu7_Auqyg?feature=player_embedded" width="540"></iframe> <br /><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>The Verge</b></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TheVerge">The Verge</a> takes a detailed look at the Nexus 7, with particular attention paid to new features present in Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean). In summing up Josh Topolsky calls the Nexus 7 “incredible,” not only at this $199 price point, but at any price point. He falls short of suggesting you buy this over an iPad, but only because developers need to start taking Android tablets seriously.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/EPLpHev1YnQ?feature=player_embedded" width="540"></iframe><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>CNET</b></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/CNETTV" target="_blank">CNET</a> only hives the brief overview, but it is still worth watching.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Y9odwaX2MGo?feature=player_embedded" width="540"></iframe><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>The Gadgate Show</b></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/thegadgetshow">The Gadget Show</a> offers up a short-but-sweet video review mostly filled with facts rather than opinion. According to the reviewer the Nexus 7 “is small, relatively cheap, and offers great performance.” They also suggest this tablet is “terrific value for money” despite the aforementioned lack of expandable memory or support for Flash. </span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div><br /><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Mommy Loves Tech</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MXqE0cbdock?feature=player_embedded" width="540"></iframe><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Mobile Tech Review</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/RyowcldPXCo?feature=player_embedded" width="540"></iframe><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>PhoneArena</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vp3Otpdrf1Q?feature=player_embedded" width="540"></iframe><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>The BGR Show</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jlNfUUgJ0IQ?feature=player_embedded" width="540"></iframe><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Conclusion</b></span></div><div><span style="color: #444444;"><br /></span></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">There we have it, eight video reviews of the Nexus 7 from a mixed range of sources. Some are long, some are short… some offer nothing but a brief overview of the device while some offer deep insights of both the hardware and software. All offer an opinion – hopefully an honest and unbiased one – that could and should help you decide whether to buy the Google nexus 7 or not.<br /><br />Have you already purchased the Nexus 7? If so, what do you think of it? If not, is it something you’re considering buying in the near future? What is holding you back from making the final decision to place your money down? Are you just a happy iPad owner who really doesn’t see the appeal of this young pretender? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below.</span><br /><div><br /></div></div>

	     <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7wCJxBVau6U/UB-4A-IzEGI/AAAAAAAABD0/cuW9q9zj1fQ/s1600/Bittorrent-Logo-Purple.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="136" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7wCJxBVau6U/UB-4A-IzEGI/AAAAAAAABD0/cuW9q9zj1fQ/s320/Bittorrent-Logo-Purple.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">There has been a long wait till Android had a trustworthy and robust Torrent client, but it seems like the wait is now over! The leading Torrent client on PC has now released its Android version for download on Google Play. And with that Android now has official BitTorrent support. Now it's gonna be fun downloading torrents on the go right from your Android smartphone.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Though there were some other torrent clients in&nbsp;existent before BitTorrent joined the party, but they were buggy and were not as robust as BitTorrent. But now, as the BitTorrent is officially released, lets hope that torrent support on Android will eventually get better as the app is in its beta stage.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vfx40OL_-mY/UB-2fFusnII/AAAAAAAABDc/_Pldqp8vTmY/s1600/Screenshot_2012-08-06-17-16-15.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vfx40OL_-mY/UB-2fFusnII/AAAAAAAABDc/_Pldqp8vTmY/s1600/Screenshot_2012-08-06-17-16-15.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">As far as our testing is concerned, we didn't had much expectations from this "beta" app, but I must mention that even this beta app is so smooth and easy to operate that easily outclass the other so called competitiors. Even large files download with ease and you can easily resume the paused download right away. It also captures the .torrents from the browse which add to the ease of functionality.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dEf20XV-VmI/UB-25_mvDXI/AAAAAAAABDk/Ir4pfpSTumE/s1600/Screenshot_2012-08-06-17-19-10.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dEf20XV-VmI/UB-25_mvDXI/AAAAAAAABDk/Ir4pfpSTumE/s1600/Screenshot_2012-08-06-17-19-10.png" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Though as the app is in its early beta stages, we should not be expecting the features same as the Desktop app, but there are some basic operations such as setting download limits, and start at boot etc. Though we're pretty sure it will increase in numbers once the app moves out of the beta stages. As I use to download torrents a lot, I've been waiting for such reliable Torrent client for android, and much to the delight of the users like me, we've got one.</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_i67SrKut80/UB-3ap4ue4I/AAAAAAAABDs/Ynrm_Bj-aDk/s1600/Screenshot_2012-08-06-17-20-06.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_i67SrKut80/UB-3ap4ue4I/AAAAAAAABDs/Ynrm_Bj-aDk/s1600/Screenshot_2012-08-06-17-20-06.png" /></a></div><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">At TechnoTravel.in we recommend readers to download this app which is, of course, available for free as of now and submit feedback via comment on Google Play to help the app grow more and serve Torrent freaks!</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bittorrent.client" target="_blank">Download BitTorrent Beta</a> (From <a href="https://play.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Play</a>)</span><br /><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div>
